        "\n",
        "Therefore, if you're a developer in South Korea, you've likely had (or will have) experience dealing with **.hwp** documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, it's not yet integrated with LangChain, so we'll need to use a custom-implemented `HWPLoader` with `langchain-teddynote` and `langchain-opentutorial` .\n",

        "In this tutorial, we'll implement a `HWPLoader` that can load **.hwp** files and extract text from them.\n",
