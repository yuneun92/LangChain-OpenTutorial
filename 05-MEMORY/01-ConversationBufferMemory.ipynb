    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the `ConversationBufferMemory` class, which is a memory class that stores conversation history in a buffer.  \n",
    "Usually, it doesn't need any additional processing, but sometimes it may be required, such as when the conversation history is too large to fit in the context window of the model.  \n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `ConversationBufferMemory` class to store and retrieve conversation history.\n",

      "Hello again! Opening a bank account remotely is a convenient process, and I’m happy to guide you through it. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Research and Choose a Bank**: Start by researching different banks to find one that suits your needs. Consider factors like account fees, interest rates, customer service, and any special features they offer. Online reviews and comparison websites can be helpful in making your decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Visit the Bank’s Website**: Once you’ve chosen a bank, head to their official website. Look for the section dedicated to personal banking or account opening. Most banks have a clear pathway for opening accounts online.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Select the Type of Account**: Decide on the type of account you want to open. Common options include checking accounts, savings accounts, or a combination of both. Some banks also offer specialized accounts like student accounts or high-yield savings accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Prepare Required Documents**: Gather the necessary documents and information. Typically, you’ll need:\n",
      "   - A government-issued ID (such as a passport or driver’s license)\n",
      "   - Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number\n",
      "   - Proof of address (like a utility bill or lease agreement)\n",
      "   - Employment and income information\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Fill Out the Application**: Complete the online application form by entering your personal details, selecting your account preferences, and agreeing to the bank’s terms and conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Verify Your Identity**: The bank will likely require you to verify your identity. This might involve uploading a photo of your ID, answering security questions, or participating in a video call with a bank representative.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Fund Your Account**: You’ll need to make an initial deposit to activate your account. This can usually be done via a transfer from another bank account, a credit card, or a check.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Receive Confirmation**: Once your application is approved and your account is funded, you’ll receive confirmation from the bank. This might include your account number, online banking login details, and information on how to manage your account.\n",
