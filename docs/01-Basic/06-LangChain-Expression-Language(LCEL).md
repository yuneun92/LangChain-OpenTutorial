## Utilizing Prompt Templates

`PromptTemplate`

- A prompt template is used to create a complete prompt string by incorporating the user's input variables.
- Usage
  - `template`: A template string is a predefined format where curly braces '{}' are used to represent variables.

  - `input_variables`: The names of the variables to be inserted within the curly braces are defined as a list.

`input_variables`

- `input_variables` is a list that defines the names of the variables used in the `PromptTemplate`.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

The `from_template()` method is used to create a `PromptTemplate` object.

```python
# Define template
template = "What is the capital of {country}?"

# Create a `PromptTemplate` object using the `from_template` method.
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
prompt_template
```




<pre class="custom">PromptTemplate(input_variables=['country'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='What is the capital of {country}?')</pre>



```python
# Generate the prompt.
prompt = prompt_template.format(country="Korea")
prompt
```




<pre class="custom">'What is the capital of Korea?'</pre>



```python
# Generate the prompt.
prompt = prompt_template.format(country="USA")
prompt
```




<pre class="custom">'What is the capital of USA?'</pre>



```python
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.1)
```

## Chain Creation

### LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)

Here, we use LCEL to combine various components into a single chain.

![lcel.png](./img/02-langchain-expression-language.png)

```
chain = prompt | model | output_parser
```

The `|` symbol works similarly to the [Unix pipe operator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>), linking different components and passing the output of one component as the input to the next.

In this chain, user input is passed to the prompt template, and the output from the prompt template is then forwarded to the model. By examining each component individually, you can understand what happens at each step.

```python
# Create the prompt as a `PromptTemplate` object.
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Please explain {topic} in simple terms.")


# Combine the prompt and model into a chain
chain = prompt | model
```

### Calling `invoke()`

- Input values are provided in the form of a Python dictionary (key-value pairs).  
- When calling the `invoke()` function, these input values are passed as arguments.

```python
# Set the topic in the `input` dictionary to 'The Principles of Learning in Artificial Intelligence Models'.
input = {"topic": "The Principles of Learning in Artificial Intelligence Models"}
```

```python
# Connect the `prompt` object and the `model` object using the pipe (`|`) operator.
# Use the `invoke` method to pass the `input`.
# This will return the message generated by the AI model.
chain.invoke(input)
```




<pre class="custom">AIMessage(content='Sure! The principles of learning in artificial intelligence (AI) models can be understood as the basic ideas that guide how these models learn from data. Here are some key principles explained in simple terms:\n\n1. **Data is Key**: AI models learn from data. The more relevant and high-quality data they have, the better they can learn and make predictions. Think of it like a student learning from textbooks; the better the books, the more they learn.\n\n2. **Patterns and Features**: AI looks for patterns in the data. It identifies important features (characteristics) that help it understand the information. For example, if it’s learning to recognize cats in pictures, it might focus on features like fur texture, ear shape, and eye color.\n\n3. **Training and Testing**: AI models go through a training phase where they learn from a set of data. After training, they are tested on new data to see how well they learned. This is like practicing for a test and then taking the actual exam.\n\n4. **Feedback Loop**: AI models improve through feedback. When they make mistakes, they learn from those errors to adjust their understanding. This is similar to how a student learns from corrections on their homework.\n\n5. **Generalization**: The goal of an AI model is to generalize, meaning it should perform well not just on the data it was trained on, but also on new, unseen data. This is like a student who studies a variety of problems and can solve new ones on the exam.\n\n6. **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting happens when a model learns too much from the training data, including noise and outliers, making it less effective on new data. Underfitting occurs when it doesn’t learn enough. It’s like a student who either memorizes answers without understanding or doesn’t study enough to grasp the concepts.\n\n7. **Algorithms**: Different algorithms (methods) are used for learning. Some are better for certain types of data or tasks. Choosing the right algorithm is like picking the best study method for a subject.\n\n8. **Continuous Learning**: AI can continue to learn over time as it receives more data. This is similar to lifelong learning, where a person keeps gaining knowledge and skills throughout their life.\n\nIn summary, AI models learn from data by identifying patterns, receiving feedback, and adjusting their understanding to perform well on new information. The principles of learning help guide this process to make AI more effective and accurate.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 507, 'prompt_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 528, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0aa8d3e20b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c6e9d1b4-7fae-4af5-8217-1456c5b23d24-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 21, 'output_tokens': 507, 'total_tokens': 528, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})</pre>



Below is an example of outputting a streaming response:

```

<pre class="custom">Sure! The Principles of Learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models can be understood as the basic ideas that guide how AI systems learn from data and improve their performance over time. Here are some key principles explained in simple terms:
    
    1. **Data is Key**: AI models learn from data. The more quality data they have, the better they can learn. Think of it like a student studying for a test; the more information they have, the better they can do.
    
    2. **Learning from Examples**: AI models learn by looking at examples. For instance, if you show an AI many pictures of cats and dogs, it can learn to tell the difference between them. This is similar to how humans learn by observing and practicing.
    
    3. **Feedback Loop**: AI models improve through feedback. When they make mistakes, they can adjust their understanding based on the corrections. This is like a teacher giving feedback to a student to help them learn from their errors.
    
    4. **Generalization**: AI models aim to generalize from the examples they see. This means they should be able to apply what they've learned to new, unseen data. For example, if an AI learns to recognize cats from specific pictures, it should still recognize a cat it has never seen before.
    
    5. **Optimization**: AI models often use optimization techniques to improve their performance. This involves tweaking their internal settings to minimize errors. It’s like fine-tuning a musical instrument to get the best sound.
    
    6. **Adaptability**: Good AI models can adapt to new information. If the environment changes or new data comes in, they can adjust their learning accordingly. This is similar to how people learn to adapt to new situations.
    
    7. **Scalability**: AI models should be able to handle increasing amounts of data without losing performance. This means they can learn from more examples as they become available, much like how a student can learn more as they read more books.
    
    8. **Transfer Learning**: Sometimes, knowledge gained from one task can help with another task. For example, if an AI learns to recognize animals, it might use that knowledge to help recognize different types of objects. This is like how learning to ride a bike can help you learn to ride a motorcycle.
    
    9. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: AI models need to balance exploring new possibilities (trying new things) and exploiting what they already know (using what works well). This is similar to how a person might try new foods while still enjoying their favorite dishes.
    
    These principles help guide the development and training of AI models, making them more effective and efficient in learning from data and performing tasks.</pre>

### Output Parser

An **Output Parser** is a tool designed to transform or process the responses from an AI model into a specific format. Since the model's output is typically provided as free-form text, an **Output Parser** is essential to convert it into a structured format or extract the required data.


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

output_parser = (
    StrOutputParser()
)  # Directly returns the model's response as a string without modification.
```

An output parser is added to the chain.

```python
# A processing chain is constructed by connecting the prompt, model, and output parser.
chain = prompt | model | output_parser
```

```python
# Use the invoke method of the chain object to pass the input
chain.invoke(input)
```

Think of it like a student studying for a test; the more information they have, the better they can prepare.\n\n2. **Learning from Examples**: AI models often learn by looking at examples. For instance, if you want to teach an AI to recognize cats in pictures, you show it many pictures of cats and non-cats. The model learns to identify patterns that distinguish cats from other objects.\n\n3. **Feedback Loop**: AI models improve through feedback. After making predictions or decisions, they receive feedback on whether they were right or wrong. This feedback helps them adjust and learn from their mistakes, similar to how a coach helps an athlete improve.\n\n4. **Generalization**: A good AI model can generalize from the examples it has seen to make predictions about new, unseen data. For example, if it has learned to recognize cats from various pictures, it should be able to identify a new cat picture it hasn't seen before.\n\n5. **Overfitting and Underfitting**: These are common problems in AI learning. Overfitting happens when a model learns too much from the training data, including noise and outliers, making it perform poorly on new data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and doesn’t learn enough from the data. The goal is to find a balance where the model learns well without being too specific to the training data.\n\n6. **Continuous Learning**: AI models can continue to learn and improve over time. This means they can adapt to new data and changing environments, much like how people keep learning throughout their lives.\n\n7. **Algorithms Matter**: The methods or algorithms used to train AI models are crucial. Different algorithms can lead to different learning outcomes, just like different teaching methods can affect how well students learn.\n\n8. **Evaluation and Testing**: To know how well an AI model is learning, it needs to be tested on separate data that it hasn’t seen before. This helps to evaluate its performance and ensure it’s not just memorizing the training data.\n\nIn summary, the principles of learning in AI models revolve around using data effectively, learning from examples, receiving feedback, generalizing knowledge, avoiding common pitfalls, and continuously improving. These principles help AI systems become more accurate and useful over time."</pre>
