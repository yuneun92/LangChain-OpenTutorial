## Basic Prompts

The Basic Prompts chapter covers summarization tasks that are most commonly used across all domains. These prompts can be used individually or combined in a pipeline:


1. **Sequential Processing**
   ```python
   documents → Summary Prompt → Map Prompt → Reduce Prompt → Final Output
   ```

2. **Parallel Processing**
   ```python
   documents → Multiple Summary Prompts (parallel)
            → Map Prompts (parallel)
            → Single Reduce Prompt
            → Final Output
   ```

3. **Hybrid Processing**
   ```python
   documents → Summary Prompt
            → Map Prompt (for themes)
            → Reduce Prompt (for final synthesis)
            → Additional Summary Prompt (for final polish)
   ```



### 1. Summary Prompt

The Summary Prompt is designed to create concise, informative summaries of documents while maintaining key information and context.



```python
PROMPT_OWNER = "eun"
```

```python
from langchain import hub

- Target Length: {length}

PROCESS:
1. Initial Summary
2. Entity Identification
3. Density Enhancement
4. Quality Check

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Maintain consistent length
2. Increase information density
3. Preserve key entities
4. Ensure readability

Please provide the summary following this structure:

FORMAT:
{
    "initial_summary": str,
    "entity_map": list,
    "refined_summaries": list,
    "final_summary": str
}
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(chain_density_prompt)
```

```python
hub.push(prompt_title, prompt, new_repo_is_public=False)
```




<pre class="custom">'https://smith.langchain.com/prompts/chain-of-density/a9eac13f?organizationId=f2bffb3c-dd45-53ac-b23b-5d696451d11c'</pre>



### 1.1. Chain of Density (Multilingual)
Generate increasingly dense summaries in any specified language through iterative refinement while maintaining semantic accuracy.

```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt_title = "chain-of-density-multilingual"

chain_density_multilingual = """
Article: {ARTICLE}
Language: {LANGUAGE}

You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article in the specified language.

Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary.
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities.

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the main story,
- specific yet concise (100 words or fewer),
- novel (not in the previous summary),
- faithful (present in the article),
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

Guidelines:
- The first summary should be long (8-10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary
- Never drop entities from the previous summary

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[
    {
        "Missing_Entities": str,
        "Denser_Summary": str
    }
]

Provide the output in the specified language: {LANGUAGE}
"""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(chain_density_multilingual)

# Usage Example:
response = chain_density_multilingual.format(
    ARTICLE="Your article text here", LANGUAGE="Spanish"
)
```

### 1.2. Chain of Density Map (Multilingual)

 Create mapped summaries with increasing density in any specified language, focusing on key entity extraction and relationship mapping.


```python
from langchain import hub

prompt_title = "chain-of-density-map-multilingual"

chain_density_map_multilingual = """
Article: {ARTICLE}
Language: {LANGUAGE}

You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article in the specified language.

Repeat the following 2 steps 3 times.

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previous summary.
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length covering all previous entities plus new ones.

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the main story,
- specific yet concise (100 words or fewer),
- novel (not in the previous summary),
- faithful (present in the article),
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

Guidelines:
- First summary: 8-10 sentences (~200 words), non-specific with fillers
- Optimize word usage and improve flow
- Remove uninformative phrases
- Maintain density and self-containment
- Preserve all previous entities

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Text format for "Missing Entities" and "Denser_Summary"

Provide the output in the specified language: {LANGUAGE}
"""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(chain_density_map_multilingual)
