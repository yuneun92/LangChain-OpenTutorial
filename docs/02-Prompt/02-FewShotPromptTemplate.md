## Overview

LangChain's Few-Shot Prompting provides a robust framework for guiding language models to generate high-quality outputs by supplying carefully selected examples. This technique minimizes the need for extensive model fine-tuning while ensuring precise, context-aware results across diverse use cases.

- **Few-Shot Prompt Templates**: Define the structure and format of prompts by embedding illustrative examples, guiding the model to produce consistent outputs.
- **Example Selection Strategies**: Dynamically select the most relevant examples for a given query, enhancing the model's contextual understanding and response accuracy.
- **Chroma Vector Store**: A powerful utility for storing and retrieving examples based on semantic similarity, enabling scalable and efficient prompt construction.

## FewShotPromptTemplate

Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique that guides language models to produce accurate and contextually relevant outputs by providing a small set of carefully designed examples. LangChain's `FewShotPromptTemplate` streamlines this process, allowing users to construct flexible and reusable prompts for various tasks like question answering, summarization, and correction.

1. **Designing Few-Shot Prompts**

   - Define examples that illustrate the desired structure and style of the output.
   - Ensure examples cover edge cases to improve model understanding and performance.

2. **Dynamic Example Selection**

   - Use semantic similarity techniques or vector-based search to select the most relevant examples for a query.

3. **Integrating Few-Shot Prompts**

   - Combine prompt templates with language models to create robust chains for generating responses.

### FewShotPromptTemplate Example

The `FewShotPromptTemplate` allows you to provide a language model with a small set of examples that demonstrate the desired structure and format of its output. By leveraging these examples, the model can better understand the context and generate more accurate responses for new queries. This technique is especially useful for tasks like question answering, summarization, or generating structured outputs.

Below, we define a few examples to help the model answer questions more effectively by breaking them down into intermediate steps. We then use the `FewShotPromptTemplate` to format the prompt dynamically based on the query.

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0,  # Creativity
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Use a valid model name
)

# User query
question = "What is the capital of United States of America?"

# Query the model
response = llm.predict(question)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

<pre class="custom">The capital of the United States of America is Washington, D.C.

## Dynamic Example Selection with Chroma

Sometimes we need to go through multiple steps of thinking to evaluate a single question. Breaking down the question into steps and guiding towards the desired answer can lead to better quality responses.
`Chroma` provides an efficient way to store and retrieve examples based on semantic similarity, enabling dynamic example selection in workflows.

1. **Embedding and Vector Store Initialization**

   - Use `OpenAIEmbeddings` to embed examples.
   - Store the embeddings in a `Chroma` vector store for efficient retrieval.

2. **Example Storage**

   - Examples are stored with both their content and metadata.
   - Metadata can include details such as the question and answer, which are used for further processing after retrieval.

3. **Similarity Search**

   - Query the vector store to retrieve the most similar examples based on the input.
   - Enables context-aware dynamic prompt creation.

Import the necessary packages and create a vector store.

```python
from langchain_openai.embeddings.base import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.example_selectors import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize embeddings and vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
chroma = Chroma(persist_directory="example_selector", embedding_function=embeddings)
```

Create example question-answer processes needed to derive the answer.

```python
examples = [
    {
        "question": "Who lived longer, Steve Jobs or Einstein?",
        "answer": """Does this question require additional questions: Yes.
Additional Question: At what age did Steve Jobs die?
Intermediate Answer: Steve Jobs died at the age of 56.
Additional Question: At what age did Einstein die?
Intermediate Answer: Einstein died at the age of 76.
The final answer is: Einstein

    },
]
```

Create a vector store and define the DynamicFewShotLearning template.

```python
# Add examples to the vector store
texts = [example["question"] for example in examples]
metadatas = [example for example in examples]
chroma.add_texts(texts=texts, metadatas=metadatas)

# Set up Example Selector
example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector(
    vectorstore=chroma,  # Only vectorstore is needed
    k=1  # Number of examples to select
)

# Define Few-Shot Prompt Template
example_prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Question:\n{question}\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n"
)
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt_template,
    suffix="Question:\n{question}\nAnswer:",
    input_variables=["question"],
)

```

Let's run it to verify if it produces answers through our desired process.

```python
# Query input and process
query = {"question": "How old was Elon Musk when he made Paypal?"}
formatted_prompt = prompt.format(**query)

# Print the constructed prompt
print("Constructed Prompt:\n")
print(formatted_prompt)

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Query the language model with the constructed prompt
response = llm.predict(formatted_prompt)
print("\nResponse:\n")
print(response)
```

<pre class="custom">Constructed Prompt:

### Resolving Similarity Search Issues in Example Selector

When calculating similarity, both `instruction` and `input` are used. However, searching based only on `instruction` does not yield accurate similarity results.

To resolve this, a custom class for similarity calculation is defined.

Below is an example of incorrectly retrieved results.
