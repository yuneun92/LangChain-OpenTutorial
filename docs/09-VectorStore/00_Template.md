[Note] If you are using a .env file, proceed as follows.

```python

load_dotenv()
```

## Credentials (to-do)

Create a new Pinecone account, or sign into your existing one, and create an API key to use in this notebook.

API Key 발급 방법 설명 ~~

`.env` 파일에 아래와 같이 추가합니다.

## Initialization
Before initializing our vector store, let's connect to a Pinecone index. If one named index_name doesn't exist, it will be created.

**주의사항**
- `metric` 은 유사도 측정 방법을 지정합니다. 만약 HybridSearch 를 고려하고 있다면 `metric` 은 `dotproduct` 로 지정합니다.

### List Indexs (to-do)

```python

: list_indexs
######################################################
'''

existing_indexes = [index_info["name"] for index_info in pc.list_indexes()]
```

### Create Index (to-do)

Pinecone 의 새로운 인덱스를 생성합니다.

![pinecone-01.png](https://github.com/teddylee777/langchain-kr/blob/main/09-VectorStore/images/pinecone-01.png?raw=1)

```python

index_name = "langchain-test-index"  # change if desired

if index_name not in existing_indexes:
    pc.create_index(

        dimension=3072,
        metric="cosine",
        spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
    )
    while not pc.describe_index(index_name).status["ready"]:
        time.sleep(1)

index = pc.Index(index_name)
```

### Delete Index (to-do)

```python
'''

```

### Select Embeddings model

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")
```

```python
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index=index, embedding=embeddings)
```

### Data Preprocessing (to-do)

Below is the preprocessing process for general documents.

- 필요한 `metadata` 정보를 추출합니다.
- 최소 길이 이상의 데이터만 필터링 합니다.
  
- 문서의 `basename` 을 사용할지 여부를 지정합니다. 기본값은 `False` 입니다.
  - 여기서 `basename` 이란 파일 경로의 가장 마지막 부분을 의미합니다.
  - 예를 들어, `/Users/teddy/data/document.pdf` 의 경우 `document.pdf` 가 됩니다.

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("./data/the_little_prince.txt") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.
    chunk_size=100,
    chunk_overlap=20,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)

split_docs = text_splitter.create_documents([raw_text])

print(split_docs)
```

## Manage vector store
Once you have created your vector store, we can interact with it by adding and deleting different items.


### Add items to vector store

We can add items to our vector store by using the add_documents function.

```python
from uuid import uuid4
from langchain_core.documents import Document

uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(docs))]
print(uuids)
vector_store.add_documents(documents=split_docs, ids=uuids)
```

### Delete items from vector store

```python
vector_store.delete(ids=[uuids[-1]])
```

### Upsert items to vector store (to-do)

```python
'''
######################################################
(TO-DO) 문서 insert+update 함수 추가
: upsert_documents
######################################################
'''

%%time
from langchain_teddynote.community.pinecone import upsert_documents

upsert_documents(
    index=pc,  # Pinecone Index
    namespace="langchain-open-tutorial-01",  # Pinecone namespace
    contents=contents,  # Previously preprocessed document content
    metadatas=metadatas,  # Previously preprocessed document metadata
    embedder=openai_embeddings,
    batch_size=32,
)
```

### Upsert items to vector store (parallel) (to-do)

```python
'''
######################################################
(TO-DO) upsert_documents_parallel 함수 추가
: upsert_documents_parallel
######################################################
'''

%%time
from langchain_teddynote.community.pinecone import upsert_documents_parallel

upsert_documents_parallel(
    index=pc,  # Pinecone Index
    namespace="langchain-open-tutorial-01",  # Pinecone namespace
    contents=contents,  # Previously preprocessed document content
    metadatas=metadatas,  # Previously preprocessed document metadata
    sparse_encoder=sparse_encoder,  # Sparse encoder
    embedder=openai_embeddings,
    batch_size=32,
)
```

## Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy",
    k=2,
    filter={"source": "tweet"},
)
for res in results:
    print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")
```

### Similarity search with score
You can also search with score:

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    "Will it be hot tomorrow?", k=1, filter={"source": "news"}
)
for res, score in results:
    print(f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")
```

### Query by turning into retreiver
You can also transform the vector store into a retriever for easier usage in your chains.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
    search_kwargs={"k": 1, "score_threshold": 0.5},
)
retriever.invoke("Stealing from the bank is a crime", filter={"source": "news"})
```

### delete_by_filter (to-do)

```python
