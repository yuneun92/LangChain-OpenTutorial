## Overview

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored, shared, or transmitted, and later reconstructed. In the LangChain framework, classes implement standard methods for serialization, providing several advantages:

- **Separation of Secrets**: Sensitive information, such as API keys, is separated from other parameters and can be securely reloaded into the object during deserialization.

- **Version Compatibility**: Deserialization remains compatible across different package versions, ensuring that objects serialized with one version of LangChain can be properly deserialized with another.

All LangChain objects inheriting from `Serializable` are JSON-serializable, including messages, document objects (e.g., those returned from retrievers), and most Runnables such as chat models, retrievers, and chains implemented with the LangChain Expression Language.

### Saving and Loading LangChain Objects

To effectively manage LangChain objects, you can serialize and deserialize them using the following functions:

- **`dumpd`**: Returns a dictionary representation of an object, suitable for JSON serialization.

- **`dumps`**: Returns a JSON string representation of an object.

- **`load`**: Reconstructs an object from its dictionary representation.

- **`loads`**: Reconstructs an object from its JSON string representation.

## Serialization with pickle

The `pickle` module in Python is used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures, also known as _pickling_ and _unpickling_. Serialization involves converting a Python object hierarchy into a byte stream, while deserialization reconstructs the object hierarchy from the byte stream.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html

### Key Functions

- **`pickle.dump(obj, file)`**: Serializes `obj` and writes it to the open file object `file`.

- **`pickle.load(file)`**: Reads a byte stream from the open file object `file` and deserializes it back into a Python object.


```python
from langchain_core.load.dump import dumpd

# Serialize LangChain object to dictionary

serialized_llm = dumpd(llm)
print(type(serialized_llm))

serialized_prompt = dumpd(prompt)
print(type(serialized_prompt))

serialized_chain = dumpd(chain)
print(type(serialized_chain))
```

<pre class="custom"><class 'dict'>

    pickle.dump(serialized_prompt, f)

with open("data/serialized_chain.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(serialized_chain, f)
```

```python
# Deserialize pickle file to dictionary

with open("data/serialized_llm.pkl", "rb") as f:
    loaded_llm = pickle.load(f)
    print(type(loaded_llm))

with open("data/serialized_prompt.pkl", "rb") as f:
    loaded_prompt = pickle.load(f)

## Is Every Runnable Serializable?

LangChain's `dumps` and `dumpd` methods attempt to serialize objects as much as possible, but the resulting data may be incomplete.

1. Even if the `is_lc_serializable` method does not exist or returns `False`, a result is still generated.
2. Even if the `is_lc_serializable` method returns `True` and serialization is successful, deserialization may fail.

After serialization, it is essential to check if the JSON data contains `"type": "not_implemented"`. Only then can the `load` or `loads` functions be used safely.


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers.string import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from langchain_core.load.dump import dumps
from langchain_core.load.load import loads


def custom_function(llm_response):
    return llm_response.content


# Define chains that make same results
chain_with_custom_function = chain | custom_function
print(type(chain_with_custom_function))
chain_with_str_output_parser = chain | StrOutputParser()
print(type(chain_with_str_output_parser))

response = chain_with_custom_function.invoke({"country": "South Korea"})
print(response)

response = chain_with_str_output_parser.invoke({"country": "South Korea"})
print(response)
