OpenAI offers a variety of model options.  
A detailed specification of these models can be found at the following link:  
[OpenAI Model Specifications](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)

### Basic Model Options

The basic API options are as follows:

- `model_name` : `str`  
  This option allows you to select the applicable model. can be aliased as `model`.

- `temperature` : `float` = 0.7    
  This option sets the sampling `temperature`. Values can range between 0 and 2. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and deterministic.

- `max_tokens` : `int` | `None` = `None`    
  Specifies the maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. This option controls the length of text the model can generate in one instance.

Detailed information about the available API options can be found [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/chat_models/langchain_openai.chat_models.base.ChatOpenAI.html).

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create a ChatOpenAI object
model = ChatOpenAI(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Model name (can be aliased as 'model')
    temperature=0,
)
```

The code provided assumes that your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables. If you would like to manually specify your API key and also choose a different model, you can use the following code:

``` python
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

```python
query = "Tell me one joke about Computer Science"

# Stream the response instead of invoking it directly
response = model.stream(query)

# Print the streamed response token by token
for token in response:
    print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
```

A detailed specification of these models can be found at the following link:  
[Perplexity Model Cards](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards)

### Basic Model Options

The basic API options are as follows:

- `model` : `str`  
  Specifies the language model to use (e.g., `"llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online"`). This determines the performance and capabilities of the response.

- `temperature` : `float` = 0.7  
  Controls the randomness of responses. A value of 0 is deterministic, while 1 allows for the most random outputs.

- `max_tokens` : `int` | `None` = `None`    
  Specifies the maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. This option controls the length of text the model can generate in one instance.

# Create a ChatPerplexity object
model = ChatPerplexity(
    model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online",
    temperature=0,
)
```

The code provided assumes that your `PPLX_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables. If you would like to manually specify your API key and also choose a different model, you can use the following code:

``` python
model = ChatPerplexity(temperature=0, pplx_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online")
```

```python
# print out response
response = model.invoke("Who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature?")

print(response.content)
print()
# ChatPerplexity stores the sources of knowledge and information in the additional_kwargs["citations"] field.
for i, citation in enumerate(response.additional_kwargs["citations"]):
    print(f"[{i+1}] {citation}")
```

```python

import os

if not os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["TOGETHER_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for Together AI: ")

from langchain_together.chat_models import ChatTogether

# Create a ChatPerplexity object
model = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo",
    temperature=0,
)
```

The code provided assumes that your `TOGETHER_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables. If you would like to manually specify your API key and also choose a different model, you can use the following code:

``` python
model = ChatTogether(temperature=0, api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo")

# Stream the response instead of invoking it directly
response = model.stream(query)

# Print the streamed response token by token
for token in response:
    print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
```

<pre class="custom">The biggest animal on the planet is the **blue whale** (Balaenoptera musculus). On average, an adult blue whale can grow up to:
    
    * 82 feet (25 meters) in length
    * Weigh around 150-170 tons (136,000-152,000 kilograms)
    
    To put that into perspective, that's equivalent to the weight of about 50 elephants or a large building. Blue whales are not only the largest animals on Earth, but they are also the largest known animals to have ever existed on our planet.
    
    These massive creatures can be found in all of the world's oceans, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and are known for their distinctive blue-gray color and massive size. Despite their enormous size, blue whales are incredibly streamlined and can swim at speeds of up to 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour.
    
    It's worth noting that while blue whales are the largest animals, there are other large animals on the planet, such as fin whales, humpback whales, and African elephants, which are also impressive in their own right. However, the blue whale remains the largest of them all.</pre>

  [Upstage Models](https://console.upstage.ai/docs/capabilities/chat)

### Basic Model Options

The basic API options are as follows:

- `model_name` : `str`  
  This option allows you to select the applicable model. can be aliased as `model`.

- `temperature` : `float` = 0.7    
  This option sets the sampling `temperature`. Values can range between 0 and 2. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and deterministic.

- `max_tokens` : `int` | `None` = `None`    
  Specifies the maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. This option controls the length of text the model can generate in one instance.

Detailed information about the available API options can be found [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/upstage/chat_models/langchain_upstage.chat_models.ChatUpstage.html).

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("UPSTAGE_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["UPSTAGE_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for Upstage: ")

from langchain_upstage import ChatUpstage 

# Create a ChatUpstage object
model = ChatUpstage(
    model_name="solar-mini", # can be alisaed as 'model'
    temperature=0,
)
```

The code provided assumes that your `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables. If you would like to manually specify your API key and also choose a different model, you can use the following code:

``` python
model = ChatUpstage(temperature=0, upstage_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", model="solar-mini")
```

```python
query = "Tell me one joke about Computer Science"

# Stream the response instead of invoking it directly
response = model.stream(query)

# Print the streamed response token by token
for token in response:
    print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
```
