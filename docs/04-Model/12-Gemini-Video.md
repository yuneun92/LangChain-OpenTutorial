## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `Gemini API` to process and analyze video content. 

Specifically, it shows how to **upload a video file** using `File API`, and then use a generative model to extract descriptive information about the video. 

The workflow utilizes the `gemini-1.5-flash` model to generate a text-based description of a given video clip.

Additionally, it provides an example of Integrating the Gemini Model into a LangChain Workflow for Video Data, showcasing how to build a chain that processes and analyzes video content seamlessly within the LangChain framework.

**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials. 
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
!pip install langchain-opentutorial
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langsmith",
        "langchain",
        "langchain_core",
        "langchain_google_genai",

    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

**API KEY Issuance**

- Obtain an API KEY from the [link](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey?hl=en).

**Important:**

- The `File API` used in this tutorial requires `API keys` for authentication and access.

- Uploaded files are linked to the cloud project associated with the `API key`.

Unlike other `Gemini APIs`, the `API key` also grants access to data uploaded via the `File API`, so it's crucial to store the `API key` securely.

```python
# Set environment variables
from langchain_opentutorial import set_env

set_env(
    {
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2": "true",
        "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT": "https://api.smith.langchain.com",
        "LANGCHAIN_PROJECT": "Video-Q&A-LLM-Gemini",
    }
)
```

<pre class="custom">Environment variables have been set successfully.
</pre>

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```




<pre class="custom">True</pre>



## Data preparation

- author: [SwissHumanity Stories](https://www.pexels.com/ko-kr/@swisshumanity-stories-1686058/)
- link: [SwissHumanity Stories's pexels](https://www.pexels.com/video/drone-footage-of-a-train-traveling-on-a-valley-8290926/)

Please download the video and copy it to the `./data` folder for the tutorial

```python
# Set video file name
video_path = "data/sample-video.mp4"
```

## Upload and Preprocess video using Gemini API

Next, use the File API to upload the video file.

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

print("Uploading files...")

# Upload the file and return the file object
video_file = genai.upload_file(path=video_path)

print(f"Upload complete: {video_file.uri}")
```

<pre class="custom">Uploading files...
    Upload complete: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ycq94nkeb9gd
</pre>

After uploading the file, you can call `get_file` to verify if the API has successfully processed the file.

`get_file` allows you to check the uploaded file associated with the File API in the cloud project linked to the API key.

```python
import time

# Videos need to be processed before you can use them.
while video_file.state.name == "PROCESSING":
    print("Please wait while the video upload and preprocessing are completed...")
    time.sleep(5)
    video_file = genai.get_file(video_file.name)

# Raise an exception if the processing fails
if video_file.state.name == "FAILED":
    raise ValueError(video_file.state.name)

# Print completion message
print(
    f"\nVideo processing is complete!\nYou can now start the conversation: {video_file.uri}"
)
```

<pre class="custom">Please wait while the video upload and preprocessing are completed...
    
    Video processing is complete!
    You can now start the conversation: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ycq94nkeb9gd
</pre>

## Generate content (Gemini API)

After the video is preprocessed, you can use the `generate_content` function from Gemini API to request questions about the video.

```python
# Prompt message
prompt = "Describe this video clip"

# Set model to Gemini 1.5 Flash
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="models/gemini-1.5-flash")

# request response to LLM
response = model.generate_content(
    [prompt, video_file], request_options={"timeout": 600}
)
# print response
print(response.text)
```

<pre class="custom">Here's a description of the video clip:
    
    The video shows an aerial, high-angle view of a red passenger train traveling along a railway line that runs parallel to a road through a picturesque valley. 
    
    
    Here's a breakdown of the scene:
    
    * **The Train:** A long, red passenger train is the central focus, moving from the bottom to the middle of the frame.  It's a fairly modern-looking train.
    
    * **The Valley:** The valley is lush green, with fields dotted with yellow wildflowers (likely dandelions).  The grass is vibrant and appears to be well-maintained pastureland. Several farmhouses and buildings are scattered throughout the valley. A small stream or river meanders alongside the road and tracks.
    
    * **The Mountains:** Towering mountains, partially snow-capped, form a dramatic backdrop. The mountains are steep and rocky, showcasing a mix of textures and shades of green and grey.
    
    * **The Atmosphere:** The overall atmosphere is peaceful and idyllic, with clear blue skies and abundant sunlight suggesting a pleasant spring or summer day.
    
    The video appears to be drone footage, smoothly following the train's progress through the valley. The camera angle provides a sweeping perspective that showcases the beauty of the landscape and the integration of the train within the environment. The entire scene evokes a sense of serene beauty and the charm of rural Switzerland.
    
</pre>

Below is an example of stream output (with the `stream=True` option added).

```python
# Prompt message
prompt = "What type of train is shown in this video, and what color is it?"

# Set model to Gemini 1.5 Flash
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="models/gemini-1.5-flash")

# request stream response to LLM
response = model.generate_content(
    [prompt, video_file], request_options={"timeout": 600}, stream=True
)

# print stream response
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end="", flush=True)
```

<pre class="custom">That's a narrow-gauge railway train.  More specifically, it appears to be a type of railcar used on the  Appenzell Bahn (AB) in Switzerland.  The train is primarily red in color, with some black and white accents.
</pre>

## Integrating the Gemini Model into a LangChain Workflow for Video Data

Here is an example of using LangChain with the Gemini model.

The model is loaded via `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` from `langchain_google_genai`, allowing multimodal data to be included in the content of `HumanMessage` using the `media` type.

```python
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Initialize the Gemini model with the specified version
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-flash")

# Create a message to send to the model and attach the video file as media input
message = HumanMessage(
    content=[
        {"type": "text", "text": "Please analyze the content of this video."},
        {
            "type": "media",
            "mime_type": video_file.mime_type,
            "file_uri": video_file.uri,
        },
    ]
)

# Stream the response and process each chunk
for chunk in llm.stream([message]):
    print(chunk.content)
```

<pre class="custom">This
     video shows an aerial view of a red train traveling along a railway line that runs
     parallel to a road through a picturesque valley in what appears to be the Swiss Alps
    . 
    
    
    Here's a breakdown of the content:
    
    * **Scenery:** The valley is lush green, with fields dotted with yellow wildflowers, likely
     dandelions.  The valley is surrounded by steep, verdant hillsides and majestic snow-capped mountains in the background. A small stream or river runs
     alongside the road and railway.  Several farmhouses or chalets are scattered throughout the valley.  The overall impression is one of idyllic rural Switzerland.
    
    * **Transportation:** A long red train is the central focus, moving steadily along the
     railway tracks. The train appears to be a passenger train, given its length and the typical design.  A road runs parallel to the tracks, offering a contrasting mode of transportation.
    
    * **Camera Work:** The video is shot from a
     drone, providing a high-angle, sweeping perspective. The camera follows the train as it moves through the valley, giving viewers a sense of the scale and beauty of the landscape. The drone maintains a relatively constant distance and speed to follow the train.
    
    * **Overall Impression:** The video is visually stunning and evokes a
     sense of tranquility and the beauty of nature in a mountainous region.  It's a perfect example of promotional footage for tourism, showcasing Switzerland's landscapes and transportation infrastructure.

## File Deletion

Files are automatically deleted after 2 days, or you can manually delete them using files.delete().

```python
# File deletion
genai.delete_file(video_file.name)

print(f"The video has been deleted: {video_file.uri}")
```

<pre class="custom">The video has been deleted: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ycq94nkeb9gd
