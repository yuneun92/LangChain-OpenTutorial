- Built-in safety measures
- Enhanced context retention

For more detailed information, please refer to [OpenAI's official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#models-overview).

## Meta - Llama Series

Meta's Llama AI series offers open-source models that allow fine-tuning, distillation, and flexible deployment.

### Model Variants

1. **Llama 3.1 (Multilingual)**
   - **8B**: Light-weight, ultra-fast model for mobile and edge devices
   - **405B**: Flagship foundation model for diverse use cases

2. **Llama 3.2 (Lightweight and Multimodal)**
   - **1B and 3B**: Efficient models for on-device processing
   - **11B and 90B**: Multimodal models with high-resolution image reasoning

3. **Llama 3.3 (Multilingual)**
   - **70B**: Multilingual support with enhanced performance

### Llama 3.3 Overview

**Safety Features**
- Incorporates alignment techniques for safe responses

**Performance**
- Comparable to larger models with fewer resources

**Efficiency**
- Optimized for common GPUs, reducing hardware needs

**Language Support**
- Supports eight languages, including English and Spanish

**Training**
- Pre-trained on 15 trillion tokens
- Fine-tuned through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF

   > **Supervised Fine-tuning** : Supervised fine-tuning is a process of improving an existing AI model's performance by training it with labeled data. For example, if you want to teach the model text summarization, you provide pairs of 'original text' and 'summarized text' as training data. Through this training with correct answer pairs, the model can enhance its performance on specific tasks.
   >
   > **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** : RLHF is a method where AI models learn to generate better responses through human feedback. When the AI generates responses, humans evaluate them, and the model improves based on these evaluations. Just like a student improves their skills through teacher feedback, AI develops to provide more ethical and helpful responses through human feedback.
   
**Use Cases**
