## Overview

HWP is Hangeul Word Processor developed by **Hancom** , and it is Korea's representative office software.

It uses the **.hwp** file extension and is widely used in Businesses, Schools, and Government Institutions, and more.

Therefore, if you're a developer in South Korea, you've likely had (or will have) experience dealing with **.hwp** documents.

Unfortunately, it's not yet integrated with LangChain, so we'll need to use a custom-implemented `HWPLoader` with `langchain-teddynote` and `langchain-opentutorial` .


In this tutorial, we'll implement a `HWPLoader` that can load **.hwp** files and extract text from them.

## Environment Setup

Set up the environment. You may refer to [Environment Setup](https://wikidocs.net/257836) for more details.

**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials. 
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install langchain-opentutorial langchain-teddynote
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langchain-teddynote",
    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

<pre class="custom">

</pre>

## HWP Loader Instantiate

You can instantiate HWP Loader with `HWPLoader` class.

```python
from langchain_teddynote.document_loaders import HWPLoader

loader = HWPLoader(file_path="data/Regulations_of_the_Establishment_and_Operation_of_the_National_Artificial_Intelligence_Committee.hwp")
```

### Loader

You can load the document with `load` method.

```python
docs = loader.load()

print(docs[0].page_content[:1000])
```
