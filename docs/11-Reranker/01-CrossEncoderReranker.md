## Overview

The **Cross Encoder Reranker** is a technique designed to enhance the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This guide explains how to implement a reranker using Hugging Face's cross-encoder model to refine the ranking of retrieved documents, promoting those most relevant to a query.

## Key Features and Mechanism

### Purpose
- Re-rank retrieved documents to refine their ranking, prioritizing the most relevant results for the query.

### Structure
- Accepts both the `query` and `document` as a single input pair, enabling joint processing.

### Mechanism
- **Single Input Pair**:  
  Processes the `query` and `document` as a combined input to output a relevance score directly.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**:  
  Uses self-attention to jointly analyze the `query` and `document`, effectively capturing their semantic relationship.

### Advantages
- **Higher Accuracy**:  
  Provides more precise similarity scores.
- **Deep Contextual Analysis**:  
  Explores semantic nuances between `query` and `document`.

### Limitations
- **High Computational Costs**:  
  Processing can be time-intensive.
- **Scalability Issues**:  
  Not suitable for large-scale document collections without optimization.

---

## Practical Applications
- A **Bi-Encoder** quickly retrieves candidate `documents` by computing lightweight similarity scores.  
- A **Cross Encoder** refines these results by deeply analyzing the semantic relationship between the `query` and the retrieved `documents`.

---

## Implementation
- Use Hugging Face cross encoder models, such as `BAAI/bge-reranker`.
- Easily integrate with frameworks like `LangChain` through the `CrossEncoderReranker` component.

---

## Key Advantages of Reranker
- **Precise Similarity Scoring**:  
  Delivers highly accurate measurements of relevance between the `query` and `documents`.
- **Semantic Depth**:  
  Analyzes deeper semantic relationships, uncovering nuances in `query-document` interactions.
- **Refined Search Quality**:  
  Improves the relevance and quality of the retrieved `documents`.
- **RAG System Boost**:  
  Enhances the performance of `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` systems by refining input relevance.
- **Seamless Integration**:  
  Easily adaptable to various workflows and compatible with multiple frameworks.
- **Model Versatility**:  
  Offers flexibility with a wide range of pre-trained models for tailored use cases.

---

## Document Count Settings for Reranker
- Reranking is generally performed on the top `5–10` `documents` retrieved during the initial search.
- The ideal number of `documents` for reranking should be determined through experimentation and evaluation, as it depends on the dataset characteristics and computational resources available.

---

## Trade-offs When Using a Reranker
- **Accuracy vs Processing Time**:  
  Striking a balance between achieving higher accuracy and minimizing processing time.
- **Performance Improvement vs Computational Cost**:  
  Weighing the benefits of improved performance against the additional computational resources required.
- **Search Speed vs Relevance Accuracy**:  
  Managing the trade-off between faster retrieval and maintaining high relevance in results.
- **System Requirements**:  
  Ensuring the system meets the necessary hardware and software requirements to support reranking.
- **Dataset Characteristics**:  
  Considering the scale, diversity, and specific attributes of the `dataset` to optimize reranker performance.

Explaining the Implementation of Cross Encoder Reranker with a Simple Example

```python
# Helper function to format and print document content
def pretty_print_docs(docs):
    # Print each document in the list with a separator between them
    print(
        f"\n{'-' * 100}\n".join(  # Separator line for better readability
            [f"Document {i+1}:\n\n" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]  # Format: Document number + content
        )
    )
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load documents
documents = TextLoader("./data/appendix-keywords.txt").load()

# Configure text splitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)

# Split documents into chunks
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Set up the embedding model
embeddings_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-dot-v5"
)

# Create FAISS index from documents and set up retriever
retriever = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings_model).as_retriever(
    search_kwargs={"k": 10}
)

# Define the query
query = "Can you tell me about Word2Vec?"

# Execute the query and retrieve results
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

# Display the retrieved documents
pretty_print_docs(docs)
