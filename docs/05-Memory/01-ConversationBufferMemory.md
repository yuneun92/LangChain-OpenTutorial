## Overview

This tutorial introduces the `ConversationBufferMemory` class, which is a memory class that stores conversation history in a buffer.  
Usually, it doesn't need any additional processing, but sometimes it may be required, such as when the conversation history is too large to fit in the context window of the model.  
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `ConversationBufferMemory` class to store and retrieve conversation history.

## Extract messages as strings

This memory allows you to extract messages into a variable after storing them.


```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory
```

<pre class="custom">/tmp/ipykernel_188575/2223904900.py:1: LangChainDeprecationWarning: Please see the migration guide at: https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_memory/
      memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
</pre>




    ConversationBufferMemory(chat_memory=InMemoryChatMessageHistory(messages=[]))



You can use the `save_context(inputs, outputs)` method to save conversation records.

- This method takes two arguments, `inputs` and `outputs`.
- `inputs` stores the user's input, and `outputs` stores the AI's output.
- Using this method saves the conversation record under the `history` key.
- Later, you can use the `load_memory_variables` method to check the saved conversation record.


```python
# inputs: dictionary(key: "human" or "ai", value: question)
# outputs: dictionary(key: "ai" or "human", value: answer)
memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?",
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification."
    },
)
```

```python
memory
```




<pre class="custom">ConversationBufferMemory(chat_memory=InMemoryChatMessageHistory(messages=[HumanMessage(content='Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content="Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]))</pre>



The `load_memory_variables({})` function of memory returns the message history.

```python
# Check the message history stored in the 'history' key.
print(memory.load_memory_variables({})["history"])
```

<pre class="custom">Human: Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?
    AI: Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification.
</pre>

```python
memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "Yes, I've prepared my ID for identity verification. What should I do next?"
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "Thank you. Please upload the front and back of your ID clearly. We will proceed with the identity verification process next."
    },
)
```

```python
# Check the message history stored in the 'history' key.
print(memory.load_memory_variables({})["history"])
```

<pre class="custom">Human: Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?
    AI: Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification.
    Human: Yes, I've prepared my ID for identity verification. What should I do next?
    AI: Thank you. Please upload the front and back of your ID clearly. We will proceed with the identity verification process next.
</pre>

```python
# Save 2 conversations.
memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "I uploaded the photo. How do I proceed with identity verification?"
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "We have confirmed the photo you uploaded. Please proceed with identity verification through your mobile phone. Please enter the verification number sent by text."
    },
)
memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "I entered the verification number. How do I open an account now?"
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "Identity verification has been completed. Please select the type of account you want and enter the necessary information. You can choose the type of deposit, currency, etc."
    },
)
```

```python

## Extract messages as `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` objects

Setting `return_messages=True` returns `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` objects.


```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)

memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?",
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification.",
    },
)

memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "Yes, I've prepared my ID for identity verification. What should I do next?"
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "Thank you. Please upload the front and back of your ID clearly. We will proceed with the identity verification process next."
    },
)

memory.save_context(
    inputs={
        "human": "I uploaded the photo. How do I proceed with identity verification?"
    },
    outputs={
        "ai": "We have confirmed the photo you uploaded. Please proceed with identity verification through your mobile phone. Please enter the verification number sent by text."
    },
)
```

```python
# Check the conversation history stored in the 'history' key.
memory.load_memory_variables({})["history"]
```




<pre class="custom">[HumanMessage(content='Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
     AIMessage(content="Hello! I'm glad you want to open an account. First, please prepare your ID for identity verification.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
     HumanMessage(content="Yes, I've prepared my ID for identity verification. What should I do next?", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),

     AIMessage(content='We have confirmed the photo you uploaded. Please proceed with identity verification through your mobile phone. Please enter the verification number sent by text.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]</pre>



## Apply to Chain

Let's apply the `ConversationBufferMemory` to the `ConversationChain`.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Create an LLM model.
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4o")

# Create a ConversationChain.
conversation = ConversationChain(
    # Use ConversationBufferMemory.
    llm=llm,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(),
)
```

<pre class="custom">/tmp/ipykernel_188575/3549519840.py:8: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `ConversationChain` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.7 and will be removed in 1.0. Use :meth:`~RunnableWithMessageHistory: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.history.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html` instead.
      conversation = ConversationChain(
</pre>

Proceed with the conversation using the `ConversationChain`.

```python
# Start the conversation.
response = conversation.predict(
    input="Hello, I want to open a bank account remotely. How do I start?"
)
print(response)
```

<pre class="custom">Hello again! Opening a bank account remotely is a convenient process, and I’m happy to guide you through it. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to help you get started:
    
    1. **Research and Choose a Bank**: Start by researching different banks to find one that suits your needs. Consider factors like account fees, interest rates, customer service, and any special features they offer. Online reviews and comparison websites can be helpful in making your decision.
    
    2. **Visit the Bank’s Website**: Once you’ve chosen a bank, head to their official website. Look for the section dedicated to personal banking or account opening. Most banks have a clear pathway for opening accounts online.
    
    3. **Select the Type of Account**: Decide on the type of account you want to open. Common options include checking accounts, savings accounts, or a combination of both. Some banks also offer specialized accounts like student accounts or high-yield savings accounts.
    
    4. **Prepare Required Documents**: Gather the necessary documents and information. Typically, you’ll need:
       - A government-issued ID (such as a passport or driver’s license)
       - Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number
       - Proof of address (like a utility bill or lease agreement)
       - Employment and income information
    
    5. **Fill Out the Application**: Complete the online application form by entering your personal details, selecting your account preferences, and agreeing to the bank’s terms and conditions.
    
    6. **Verify Your Identity**: The bank will likely require you to verify your identity. This might involve uploading a photo of your ID, answering security questions, or participating in a video call with a bank representative.
    
    7. **Fund Your Account**: You’ll need to make an initial deposit to activate your account. This can usually be done via a transfer from another bank account, a credit card, or a check.
    
    8. **Receive Confirmation**: Once your application is approved and your account is funded, you’ll receive confirmation from the bank. This might include your account number, online banking login details, and information on how to manage your account.
    
    9. **Set Up Online Banking**: If you haven’t already, set up online banking to manage your account. This will allow you to check your balance, transfer funds, pay bills, and more.
    
    If you have any specific questions about a particular bank or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
