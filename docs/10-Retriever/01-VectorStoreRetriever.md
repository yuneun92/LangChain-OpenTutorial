## Overview
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building and optimizing a **VectorStore-backed retriever** using LangChain. It covers the foundational steps of creating a vector store with FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) and explores advanced retrieval strategies for improving search accuracy and efficiency.

A **VectorStore-backed retriever** is a document retrieval system that leverages a vector store to search for documents based on their vector representations. This approach enables efficient similarity-based search for handling unstructured data.


### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Workflow
<img src="./assets/01-vectorstore-retriever-rag-flow.png" alt="rag-flow" width="1000">

The diagram above illustrates the  **document search and response generation** workflow within a RAG system. 

The steps include:

1. Document Loading: Importing raw documents.  
2. Text Chunking: Splitting text into manageable chunks.  
3. Vector Embedding: Converting the text into numerical vectors using an embedding model.  
4. Store in Vector Database: Storing the generated embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

During the query phase:
- Steps: User Query → Embedding → Search in VectorStore → Relevant Chunks Retrieved → LLM Generates Response
- The user's query is transformed into an embedding vector using an embedding model.
- This query embedding is compared against stored document vectors within the vector database to **retrieve the most relevant results**.
- The retrieved chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a final response based on the retrieved information.

This tutorial aims to explore and optimize the VectorStore → Relevant Chunks Retrieved → LLM Generates Response stages. It will cover advanced retrieval techniques to improve the accuracy and relevance of the responses.

## Initializing and Using VectorStoreRetriever

This section demonstrates how to load documents using OpenAI embeddings and create a vector database using FAISS.

- The example below showcases how to use OpenAI embeddings for document loading and FAISS for vector database creation.
- Once the vector database is created, it can be loaded and queried using retrieval methods such as **Similarity Search** and **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** to search for relevant text within the vector store.

📌 **Creating a Vector Store (Using FAISS)**

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

# Load the file using TextLoader
loader = TextLoader("./data/01-vectorstore-retriever-appendix-keywords.txt", encoding="utf-8")
documents = loader.load()

# split the text into chunks
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=0)
split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Split into smaller chunks

# Initialize the OpenAI embedding model
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create a FAISS vector database
db = FAISS.from_documents(split_docs, embeddings)
```

<pre class="custom">Created a chunk of size 351, which is longer than the specified 300
    Created a chunk of size 343, which is longer than the specified 300
    Created a chunk of size 307, which is longer than the specified 300
    Created a chunk of size 316, which is longer than the specified 300

📌 **1. Initializing and Using VectorStoreRetriever (`as_retriever` )**

The `as_retriever` method allows you to convert a vector database into a retriever, enabling efficient document search and retrieval from the vector store.

**How It Works**:
* The `as_retriever()` method transforms a vector store (like FAISS) into a retriever object, making it compatible with LangChain's retrieval workflows.
* This retriever can then be directly used with RAG pipelines or combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) for building intelligent search systems.

```python
# Basic Retriever Creation (Similarity Search)
retriever = db.as_retriever()
```

**Advanced Retriever Configuration**

The `as_retriever` method allows you to configure advanced retrieval strategies, such as **similarity search**, **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)**, and **similarity score threshold-based filtering**.


**Parameters:**

- `**kwargs` : Keyword arguments passed to the retrieval function:
   - `search_type` : Specifies the search method.
     - `"similarity"` : Returns the most relevant documents based on cosine similarity.
     - `"mmr"` : Utilizes the Maximal Marginal Relevance algorithm, balancing **relevance** and **diversity**.
     - `"similarity_score_threshold"` : Returns documents with a similarity score above a specified threshold.
   - `search_kwargs` : Additional search options for fine-tuning results:
     - `k` : Number of documents to return (default: `4` ).
     - `score_threshold` : Minimum similarity score for the `"similarity_score_threshold"` search type (e.g., `0.8` ).
     - `fetch_k` : Number of documents initially retrieved during an MMR search (default: `20` ).
     - `lambda_mult` : Controls diversity in MMR results (`0` = maximum diversity, `1` = maximum relevance, default: `0.5` ).
     - `filter` : Metadata filtering for selective document retrieval.


 **Return Value:**

- `VectorStoreRetriever`: An initialized retriever object that can be directly queried for document search tasks.


**Notes:**
- Supports multiple search strategies (`similarity` , `MMR` , `similarity_score_threshold` ).
- MMR improves result diversity while preserving relevance by reducing redundancy in results.
- Metadata filtering enables selective document retrieval based on document properties.
- The `tags` parameter can be used to label retrievers for better organization and easier identification.

 **Cautions:**
- Diversity Control with MMR:
  - Adjust both `fetch_k` (number of documents initially retrieved) and `lambda_mult` (diversity control factor) carefully for optimal balance.
  - `lambda_mult`
    - Lower values (< 0.5) → Prioritize diversity.
    - Higher values (> 0.5) → Prioritize relevance.
  - set `fetch_k` higher than `k` for effective diversity control.
- Threshold Settings: 
  - Using a high `score_threshold` (e.g., 0.95) can lead to zero results.
- Metadata Filtering: 
  - Ensure the metadata structure is well-defined before applying filters.
- Balanced Configuration:
  - Maintain a proper balance between `search_type` and `search_kwargs` settings for optimal retrieval performance.


```python
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold", 
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 5,  # Return the top 5 most relevant documents
        "score_threshold": 0.7  # Only return documents with a similarity score of 0.7 or higher
    }
)
# Perform the search
query = "Explain the concept of vector search."
results = retriever.invoke(query)

# Display search results
for doc in results:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

### Retriever's `invoke()` Method

The `invoke()` method is the primary entry point for interacting with a Retriever. It is used to search and retrieve relevant documents based on a given query.

**How It Works** :
1. Query Submission: A user query is provided as input.
2. Embedding Generation: The query is converted into a vector representation (if necessary).
3. Search Process: The retriever searches the vector database using the specified search strategy (similarity, MMR, etc.).
4. Results Return: The method returns a list of relevant document chunks.

 **Parameters:**
- `input` (Required):
   - The query string provided by the user.
   - The query is converted into a vector and compared with stored document vectors for similarity-based retrieval.

- `config` (Optional):
   - Allows for fine-grained control over the retrieval process.
   - Can be used to specify **tags, metadata insertion, and search strategies**.

- `**kwargs` (Optional):
   - Enables direct passing of `search_kwargs` for advanced configuration.
   - Example options include:
     - `k` : Number of documents to return.
     - `score_threshold` : Minimum similarity score for a document to be included.
     - `fetch_k` : Number of documents initially retrieved in MMR searches.


 **Return Value:**
- `List[Document]`:
   - Returns a list of document objects containing the retrieved text and metadata.
   - Each document object includes:
     - `page_content` : The main content of the document.
     - `metadata` : Associated metadata with the document (e.g., source, tags).


**Usage Example 1: Basic Usage (Synchronous Search)**

### Max Marginal Relevance (MMR)

The **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** search method is a document retrieval algorithm designed to reduce redundancy by balancing relevance and diversity when returning results.

**How MMR Works:**
Unlike basic similarity-based searches that return the most relevant documents based solely on similarity scores, MMR considers two critical factors:
1. Relevance: Measures how closely the document matches the user's query.
2. Diversity: Ensures the retrieved documents are distinct from each other to avoid repetitive results.

 **Key Parameters:**
- `search_type="mmr"`: Activates the MMR retrieval strategy.  
- `k`: The number of documents returned after applying diversity filtering(default: `4`).  
- `fetch_k`: Number of documents initially retrieved before applying diversity filtering (default: `20`).  
- `lambda_mult`: Diversity control factor (`0 = max diversity` , `1 = max relevance` , default: `0.5`).

```python
# MMR Retriever Configuration (Balancing Relevance and Diversity)
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr", 
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 3,                
        "fetch_k": 10,           
        "lambda_mult": 0.6  # Balancing Similarity and Diversity (0.6: Slight Emphasis on Diversity)
    }
)

query = "What is an embedding?"
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

#  Display the search results
print(f"\n🔎 [Query]: {query}\n")
for idx, doc in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"📄 [Document {idx + 1}]")
    print("📖 Document Content:", doc.page_content)
    print("🗂️ Metadata:", doc.metadata)
    print("=" * 60)

### Similarity Score Threshold Search

**Similarity Score Threshold Search** is a retrieval method where only documents exceeding a predefined similarity score are returned. This approach helps filter out low-relevance results, ensuring that the returned documents are highly relevant to the query.

**Key Features:**
- Relevance Filtering: Returns only documents with a similarity score above the specified threshold.
- Configurable Precision: The threshold is adjustable using the `score_threshold` parameter.
- Search Type Activation: Enabled by setting `search_type="similarity_score_threshold"` .

This search method is ideal for tasks requiring **highly precise** results, such as fact-checking or answering technical queries.

```python
# Retriever Configuration (Similarity Score Threshold Search)
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold",  
    search_kwargs={
        "score_threshold": 0.6,  
        "k": 5                
    }
)
# Execute the query
query = "What is Word2Vec?"
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

# Display the search results 
print(f"\n🔎 [Query]: {query}\n")
if docs:
    for idx, doc in enumerate(docs):
        print(f"📄 [Document {idx + 1}]")
        print("📖 Document Content:", doc.page_content)
        print("🗂️ Metadata:", doc.metadata)
        print("=" * 60)
else:
    print("⚠️ No relevant documents found. Try lowering the similarity score threshold.")

### Configuring `top_k` (Adjusting the Number of Returned Documents)

- The parameter `k` specifies the number of documents returned during a vector search. It determines how many of the **top-ranked** documents (based on similarity score) will be retrieved from the vector database.

- The number of documents retrieved can be adjusted by setting the `k` value within the `search_kwargs`.  
- For example, setting `k=1` will return only the **top 1 most relevant document** based on similarity.

```python
# Retriever Configuration (Return Only the Top 1 Document)
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 1  # Return only the top 1 most relevant document
    }
)

query = "What is an embedding?"
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

#  Display the search results 
print(f"\n🔎 [Query]: {query}\n")
if docs:
    for idx, doc in enumerate(docs):
        print(f"📄 [Document {idx + 1}]")
        print("📖 Document Content:", doc.page_content)
        print("🗂️ Metadata:", doc.metadata)
        print("=" * 60)
else:
    print("⚠️ No relevant documents found. Try increasing the `k` value.")
```

## Dynamic Configuration (Using `ConfigurableField` )

The `ConfigurableField` feature in LangChain allows for **dynamic adjustment** of search configurations, providing flexibility during query execution.

**Key Features:**
- Runtime Search Configuration: Adjust search settings without modifying the core retriever setup.
- Enhanced Traceability: Assign unique identifiers, names, and descriptions to each parameter for improved readability and debugging.
- Flexible Control with `config`: Search configurations can be passed dynamically using the `config` parameter as a dictionary.


**Use Cases:**
- Switching Search Strategies: Dynamically adjust the search type (e.g., `"similarity"`, `"mmr"` ).
- Real-Time Parameter Adjustments: Modify search parameters like `k` , `score_threshold` , and `fetch_k` during query execution.
- Experimentation: Easily test different search strategies and parameter combinations without rewriting code.

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import ConfigurableField 

# Retriever Configuration Using ConfigurableField
retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 1}).configurable_fields(
    search_type=ConfigurableField(
        id="search_type", 
        name="Search Type",  # Name for the search strategy
        description="The search type to use",  # Description of the search strategy
    ),
    search_kwargs=ConfigurableField(
        id="search_kwargs",  
        name="Search Kwargs",  # Name for the search parameters
        description="The search kwargs to use",  # Description of the search parameters
    ),
)
```

The following examples demonstrate how to apply dynamic search settings using `ConfigurableField` in LangChain.


```python
# ✅ Search Configuration 1: Basic Search (Top 3 Documents)

config_1 = {"configurable": {"search_kwargs": {"k": 3}}}

# Execute the query
docs = retriever.invoke("What is an embedding?", config=config_1)

# Display the search results
print("\n🔎 [Search Results - Basic Configuration (Top 3 Documents)]")
for idx, doc in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"📄 [Document {idx + 1}]")
    print(doc.page_content)

## Using Separate Query & Passage Embedding Models

By default, a retriever uses the **same embedding model** for both queries and documents. However, certain scenarios can benefit from using different models tailored to the specific needs of queries and documents.

### Why Use Separate Embedding Models?
Using different models for queries and documents can improve retrieval accuracy and search relevance by optimizing each model for its intended purpose:
- Query Embedding Model: Fine-tuned for understanding short and concise search queries.
- Document (Passage) Embedding Model: Optimized for longer text spans with richer context.
  
For instance, **Upstage Embeddings** provides the capability to use distinct models for:  
- Query Embeddings (`solar-embedding-1-large-query`)  
- Document (Passage) Embeddings (`solar-embedding-1-large-passage`)  

In such cases, the query is embedded using the query embedding model, while the documents are embedded using the document embedding model. 

✅ **How to Issue an Upstage API Key**  
- Sign Up & Log In: 
   - Visit [Upstage](https://upstage.ai/) and log in (sign up if you don't have an account).  

- Open API Key Page:
   - Go to the menu bar, select "Dashboards", then navigate to "API Keys".

- Generate API Key:  
   - Click **"Create new key"** → Enter name your key (e.g., `LangChain-Tutorial`) 

- Copy & Store Safely:  
   - Copy the generated key and keep it secure.

The following example demonstrates the process of generating an Upstage embedding for a query, converting the query sentence into a vector, and conducting a vector similarity search.

```python
# ✅ 3. Query Embedding and Vector Search
query_embedder = UpstageEmbeddings(model="solar-embedding-1-large-query")

# Convert the query into a vector using the query embedding model
query_vector = query_embedder.embed_query("What is an embedding?")

# ✅ 4. Vector Similarity Search (Return Top 2 Documents)
results = db.similarity_search_by_vector(query_vector, k=2)

# ✅ 5. Display the Search Results
print(f"\n🔎 [Query]: What is an embedding?\n")
for idx, doc in enumerate(results):
    print(f"📄 [Document {idx + 1}]")
    print("📖 Document Content:", doc.page_content)
    print("🗂️ Metadata:", doc.metadata)
    print("=" * 60)
```
