## Overview

This tutorial focuses on implementing and comparing different ensemble retrieval methods in LangChain. While LangChain's built-in EnsembleRetriever uses the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) method, we'll explore an additional approach by implementing the **Convex Combination (CC)** method. The tutorial guides you through creating custom implementations of both RRF and CC methods, allowing for a direct performance comparison between these ensemble techniques.

## Environment Setup

Set up the environment. You may refer to [Environment Setup](https://wikidocs.net/257836) for more details.

**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials. 
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install langchain-opentutorial
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langchain_community",
        "langchain_openai",
        "langchain_core",
        "faiss-cpu",
        "pdfplumber",
        "rank_bm25",
    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

```python
# Set environment variables
from langchain_opentutorial import set_env

set_env(
    {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2": "true",
        "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT": "https://api.smith.langchain.com",

You can alternatively set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file and load it.

[Note] This is not necessary if you've already set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in previous steps.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API key information
load_dotenv(override=True)
```

##  Process Document

This section outlines the preparation process for processing PDF documents before storing them in a vector store. 

We use `PDFPlumberLoader` to load the PDF file and leverage `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to break down the document into smaller, manageable chunks. 

The chunk size is set to 200 characters with no overlap, allowing for efficient processing while maintaining the document's semantic integrity.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PDFPlumberLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load the PDF document
loader = PDFPlumberLoader("data/Introduction_LangChain.pdf")
# Split the document into manageable chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=0)
split_documents = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter)
```

## Initialize Retrievers

This section initializes retrievers to implement two different search approaches. We create embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model and set up `FAISS` vector search based on these embeddings. 

Additionally, we configure a `BM25` retriever for keyword-based search, with both retrievers set to return the top 5 most relevant results.

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever

# Initialize OpenAI embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

# Initialize FAISS retriever with vector embeddings
faiss = FAISS.from_documents(
    documents=split_documents, embedding=embeddings
).as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# Initialize BM25 retriever for keyword-based search
bm25 = BM25Retriever.from_documents(documents=split_documents)
bm25.k = 5
```

## Implement Ensemble Retrievers

This section introduces a custom retriever implementing two ensemble search methods, designed to compare performance against LangChain's built-in `EnsembleRetriever`. 

We implement both Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), which combines results based on document rankings, and **Convex Combination (CC)**, which utilizes normalized scores. 

Both methods integrate results from `FAISS` and `BM25` retrievers to provide more accurate and diverse search results, allowing users to select the most suitable ensemble approach for their needs.

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional
from langchain_core.retrievers import BaseRetriever
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from pydantic import BaseModel, model_validator


class EnsembleMethod(str, Enum):
    RRF = "rrf"  # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
    CC = "cc"  # Convex Combination

    retrievers: List[BaseRetriever]

        if not weights:
            n_retrievers = len(values["retrievers"])
            values["weights"] = [1 / n_retrievers] * n_retrievers
        elif method == EnsembleMethod.CC and abs(sum(weights) - 1.0) > 1e-6:
            raise ValueError("CC method의 경우 weights의 합이 1이어야 합니다")

# Initialize Ensemble Retriever with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) method
rrf_ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[faiss, bm25], method=EnsembleMethod.RRF
)

# Initialize Ensemble Retriever with CC (Convex Combination) method
cc_ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[faiss, bm25],
    method=EnsembleMethod.CC,
    weights=[0.5, 0.5],  # Equal weights for both retrievers
)
```

## Compare and Test

This section presents a test function for comparing ensemble retrieval results. 

While the 'RRF' method, which follows LangChain's default implementation, produces identical results to 'Original', the 'CC' method utilizing normalized scores and weights offers different search patterns. 

By testing with real queries and comparing these approaches, we can identify which ensemble method better suits our project requirements.

```python
def pretty_print(query):
    for i, (original_doc, cc_doc, rrf_doc) in enumerate(
        zip(
            original_ensemble_retriever.invoke(query),
            cc_ensemble_retriever.invoke(query),
            rrf_ensemble_retriever.invoke(query),
        )
    ):
        print(f"[{i}] [Original] Q: {query}", end="\n\n")
        print(original_doc.page_content)
        print("-" * 100)
        print(f"[{i}] [RRF] Q: {query}", end="\n\n")
        print(rrf_doc.page_content)
        print("-" * 100)
        print(f"[{i}] [CC] Q: {query}", end="\n\n")
        print(cc_doc.page_content)
        print("=" * 100, end="\n\n")
```
