## Overview

Regardless of the model's architecture, performance significantly degrades when including more than 10 retrieved documents.

Simply put, when the model needs to access relevant information in the middle of a long context, it tends to ignore the provided documents.

For more details, please refer to the following paper:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172

To avoid this issue, you can prevent performance degradation by reordering documents after retrieval.

Create a retriever that can store and search text data using the Chroma vector store.
Use the retriever's invoke method to search for highly relevant documents for a given query.

## Create an instance of the LongContextReorder class named reordering.

Enter a query for the retriever to perform the search.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_community.document_transformers import LongContextReorder
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Get embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

texts = [
    "This is just a random text I wrote.",
    "ChatGPT, an AI designed to converse with users, can answer various questions.",
    "iPhone, iPad, MacBook are representative products released by Apple.",
    "ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.",
    "ChatGPT has learned from vast amounts of data to understand user questions and generate appropriate answers.",
    "Wearable devices like Apple Watch and AirPods are also part of Apple's popular product line.",
    "ChatGPT can be used to solve complex problems or suggest creative ideas.",
    "Bitcoin is also called digital gold and is gaining popularity as a store of value.",
    "ChatGPT's capabilities are continuously evolving through ongoing learning and updates.",
    "The FIFA World Cup is held every four years and is the biggest event in international football.",
]



# Create a retriever (Set K to 10)
retriever = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embedding=embeddings).as_retriever(

```python

# Retrieves relevant documents sorted by relevance score.
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
docs

Create an instance of LongContextReorder class.

- Call reordering.transform_documents(docs) to reorder the document list.
- Less relevant documents are positioned in the middle of the list, while more relevant documents are positioned at the beginning and end.


```python
# Reorder the documents
# Less relevant documents are positioned in the middle, more relevant elements at start/end
reordering = LongContextReorder()
reordered_docs = reordering.transform_documents(docs)

# Verify that 4 relevant documents are positioned at start and end
reordered_docs
```

## Creating Question-Answering Chain with Context Reordering

A chain that enhances QA (Question-Answering) performance by reordering documents using LongContextReorder, which optimizes the arrangement of context for better comprehension and response accuracy.

```python
def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n".join([doc.page_content for i, doc in enumerate(docs)])
```

```python
print(format_docs(docs))
```

<pre class="custom">ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.
    ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.
    ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.
    ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.
    ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and is continuously being improved.
    ChatGPT, an AI designed to converse with users, can answer various questions.
    ChatGPT, an AI designed to converse with users, can answer various questions.
    ChatGPT, an AI designed to converse with users, can answer various questions.
    ChatGPT, an AI designed to converse with users, can answer various questions.

</pre>

```python
def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n".join(
        [
            f"[{i}] {doc.page_content} [source: teddylee777@gmail.com]"
            for i, doc in enumerate(docs)
        ]
    )


def reorder_documents(docs):
    # Reorder
    reordering = LongContextReorder()
    reordered_docs = reordering.transform_documents(docs)
    combined = format_docs(reordered_docs)
    print(combined)
    return combined
```

Prints the reordered documents.

```python
# Define prompt template
_ = reorder_documents(docs)
```
