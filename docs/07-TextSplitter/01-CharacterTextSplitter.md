## Overview

Text splitting is a crucial step in document processing with LangChain. 

The `CharacterTextSplitter` offers efficient text chunking that provides several key benefits:

- **Token Limits:** Overcomes LLM context window size restrictions
- **Search Optimization:** Enables more precise chunk-level retrieval
- **Memory Efficiency:** Processes large documents effectively
- **Context Preservation:** Maintains textual coherence through `chunk_overlap`

This tutorial explores practical implementation of text splitting through core methods like `split_text()` and `create_documents()`, including advanced features such as metadata handling.

## Environment Setup

Set up the environment. You may refer to [Environment Setup](https://wikidocs.net/257836) for more details.

**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials. 
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install langchain-opentutorial
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langchain_text_splitters",
    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

```python
# Set environment variables
from langchain_opentutorial import set_env

set_env(
    {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2": "true",
        "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT": "https://api.smith.langchain.com",
        "LANGCHAIN_PROJECT": "Adaptive-RAG",  # title 과 동일하게 설정해 주세요
    }
)
```

<pre class="custom">Environment variables have been set successfully.
</pre>

You can alternatively set API keys such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file and load them.

[Note] This is not necessary if you've already set the required API keys in previous steps.

```python
# Load API keys from .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv(override=True)
```




<pre class="custom">False</pre>



## CharacterTextSplitter Example

Read and store contents from keywords file
* Open `./data/appendix-keywords.txt` file and read its contents.
* Store the read contents in the `file` variable

```python
with open("./data/appendix-keywords.txt", encoding="utf-8") as f:
   file = f.read()
```

Print the first 500 characters of the file contents.

```python
print(file[:500])
```

Create `CharacterTextSplitter` with parameters:

**Parameters**

* `separator`: String to split text on (e.g., newlines, spaces, custom delimiters)
* `chunk_size`: Maximum size of chunks to return
* `chunk_overlap`: Overlap in characters between chunks
* `length_function`: Function that measures the length of given chunks
* `is_separator_regex`: Boolean indicating whether separator should be treated as a regex pattern

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
   separator=" ",           # Splits whenever a space is encountered in text
   chunk_size=250,          # Each chunk contains maximum 250 characters
   chunk_overlap=50,        # Two consecutive chunks share 50 characters
   length_function=len,     # Counts total characters in each chunk
   is_separator_regex=False # Uses space as literal separator, not as regex
)
```

Create document objects from chunks and display the first one

```python
chunks = text_splitter.create_documents([file])
print(chunks[0])
```

</pre>

Demonstrate metadata handling during document creation:

* `create_documents` accepts both text data and metadata lists
* Each chunk inherits metadata from its source document

```python
# Define metadata for each document
metadatas = [
   {"document": 1},
   {"document": 2},
]

# Create documents with metadata
documents = text_splitter.create_documents(
   [file, file],  # List of texts to split
   metadatas=metadatas,  # Corresponding metadata
)

print(documents[0])  # Display first document with metadata
```

    Definition: A vector store is a system that stores data converted to vector format. It is used for search, classification, and other data analysis tasks.
    Example: Vectors of word embeddings can be stored in a database for quick' metadata={'document': 1}
</pre>

Split text using the `split_text()` method.
* `text_splitter.split_text(file)[0]` returns the first chunk of the split text

```python
# Split the file text and return the first chunk
text_splitter.split_text(file)[0]
```
