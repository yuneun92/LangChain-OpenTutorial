    "- Design:\n",
    "- Peer Review: [Jaehun Choi](https://github.com/ash-hun), [Dooil Kwak](https://github.com/back2zion)\n",

    "[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LangChain-OpenTutorial/LangChain-OpenTutorial/blob/main/19-Cookbook/02-RecommendationSystem/03-ResumeRecommendationReview.ipynb) [![Open in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in%20GitHub-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/LangChain-OpenTutorial/blob/main/19-Cookbook/02-RecommendationSystem/03-ResumeRecommendationReview.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The ResumeRecommendationReview system is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify and enhance the job application process for individuals seeking corporate positions. The system is divided into two main components, each tailored to address key challenges faced by job seekers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Company Recommendation\n",
    "Using advanced matching algorithms, the system analyzes a user’s uploaded resume and compares it with job postings on LinkedIn. Based on this analysis, it identifies and recommends companies that align closely with the candidate’s qualifications, skills, and career aspirations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Resume Evaluation and Enhancement\n",
    "For the recommended companies, the system conducts a detailed evaluation of the user’s resume. It highlights strengths, identifies areas for improvement, and provides actionable suggestions for tailoring the resume to better fit the expectations of target roles. This ensures candidates can present their qualifications in the most impactful way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these two components, the ResumeRecommendationReview system streamlines the job application journey, empowering users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discover job opportunities that best match their unique profile.\n",
    "- Optimize their resumes for maximum impact, increasing their chances of securing interviews and job offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CV/Resume Upload**: \n",
    "  Users begin by uploading their existing CV or resume in a supported file format (e.g., PDF)\n",
    "  The system extracts relevant keywords, experiences, and skill sets to build a user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Matching with LinkedIn Postings**: \n",
    "  The platform automatically scans LinkedIn job listings (and potentially other job boards) for roles that align with the user’s skill set and career interests.\n",
    "  A matching algorithm ranks and recommends a list of the most relevant companies and positions for the candidate to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison & Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge)**  \n",
    "  The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the uploaded resume and specific job requirements. \n",
    "  It evaluates the alignment between the user's experience and the job description, identifying strengths,  skill gaps, and areas in need of improvement.\n",
    "  Additionally, the system evaluates the recommendation performance using **cosine similarity** to measure the semantic alignment and **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)** to assess the ranking quality of the recommendations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Automated Resume Enhancement**: \n",
    "  Based on the LLM evaluation, the system provides a detailed report highlighting sections that need modification.\n",
    "  Suggested edits may include restructuring experience points, emphasizing relevant skills, or adding keywords that match the job posting’s expectations.\n",

    "   - If another `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs, it falls back to a common encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fallback to CP949**:  \n",

    "## LLM-Based Resume Evaluation System\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines the implementation of a system that uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to evaluate resumes by comparing them against job descriptions. The system provides actionable insights to improve resumes and assists in aligning candidates’ qualifications with job requirements.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "What is `LLM-as-a-Judge`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LLM-as-a-Judge` system leverages the advanced reasoning and natural language understanding capabilities of an LLM to serve as an impartial evaluator in the hiring process. By acting as a \"judge,\" the LLM compares a candidate’s resume to job requirements, evaluates their alignment, and provides actionable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the `LLM-as-a-Judge` system include:\n",
    "- `Contextual Understanding`: It comprehends detailed job descriptions and resumes beyond simple keyword matching, enabling nuanced evaluations.  \n",
    "- `Feedback Generation`: Provides insights into the candidate's strengths and areas for improvement.  \n",
    "- `Decision Support`: Assists hiring managers or applicants by generating a recommendation on the candidate's suitability for the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system bridges the gap between human evaluation and automated analysis, ensuring more accurate and tailored results in the recruitment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LLM-as-a-Judge` system provides the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Detailed Analysis`: Analyzes resumes and job requirements in detail, identifying key qualifications and expectations.  \n",
    "- `Alignment Evaluation`: Assesses how well the candidate's skills and experiences match the job requirements.  \n",
    "- `Strengths and Improvement Areas`: Identifies the candidate's strengths and offers suggestions for improvement.  \n",
    "- `Role Suitability Recommendation`: Provides a final recommendation on whether the candidate is a good fit for the role.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **CriterionEvaluation**\n",
    "The `CriterionEvaluation` class evaluates individual aspects of the resume based on predefined criteria:  \n",
    "- **`score`** (`int`): A score from 1 to 5 representing the performance for a specific criterion.  \n",
    "- **`reasoning`** (`str`): A detailed explanation of why the score was assigned.  \n",
    "- **`evidence`** (`List[str]`): Specific elements from the resume that support the evaluation.  \n",
    "- **`suggestions`** (`List[str]`): Targeted recommendations for improving the evaluated area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **DetailedEvaluation**\n",
    "The `DetailedEvaluation` class provides a comprehensive evaluation of the resume by aggregating results across multiple criteria:  \n",
    "- **`technical_fit`**: Assessment of technical skills and their relevance to the job.  \n",
    "- **`experience_relevance`**: Evaluation of how well the candidate’s work experience aligns with the role.  \n",
    "- **`industry_knowledge`**: Examination of the candidate’s understanding of the target industry.  \n",
    "- **`education_qualification`**: Review of academic background and certifications.  \n",
    "- **`soft_skills`**: Analysis of interpersonal and communication skills.  \n",
    "- **`overall_score`** (`int`): A total score (0-100) summarizing the resume's performance.  \n",
    "- **`key_strengths`** (`List[str]`): Highlights of the resume's strongest areas.  \n",
    "- **`improvement_areas`** (`List[str]`): Areas requiring enhancement for better alignment with the job.  \n",
    "- **`final_recommendation`** (`str`): A conclusion on the candidate’s suitability for the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **LLMJudge**\n",
    "The `LLMJudge` class uses an LLM to evaluate resumes against job descriptions by analyzing criteria such as technical fit, experience relevance, and soft skills.  \n",
    "- **Responsibilities**:  \n",
    "  - Processes resume text and job information.  \n",
    "  - Uses a structured prompt to guide the LLM in scoring and providing feedback.  \n",
    "  - Outputs a `DetailedEvaluation` object containing scores, evidence, and suggestions.  \n",
    "- **Features**:  \n",
    "  - Dynamic prompt generation for precise LLM instructions.  \n",
    "  - Predefined evaluation criteria with customizable weights and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **ResumeEvaluationSystem**\n",
    "The `ResumeEvaluationSystem` orchestrates the entire resume evaluation process, from text extraction to generating improvement reports.  \n",
    "- **Responsibilities**:  \n",
    "  - Processes resumes to extract clean text for analysis.  \n",
    "  - Selects the most relevant jobs for evaluation based on similarity scores.  \n",
    "  - Generates detailed reports summarizing the evaluation and suggestions.  \n",
    "- **Methods**:  \n",
    "  - **`evaluate_with_recommendations`**: Evaluates a resume against the top `n` recommended jobs.  \n",
    "  - **`format_evaluation_report`**: Converts the `DetailedEvaluation` object into a readable report.  \n",
