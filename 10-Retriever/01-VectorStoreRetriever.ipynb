    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building and optimizing a **VectorStore-backed retriever** using LangChain. It covers the foundational steps of creating a vector store with FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) and explores advanced retrieval strategies for improving search accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **VectorStore-backed retriever** is a document retrieval system that leverages a vector store to search for documents based on their vector representations. This approach enables efficient similarity-based search for handling unstructured data.\n",

    "### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Workflow\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/01-vectorstore-retriever-rag-flow.png\" alt=\"rag-flow\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above illustrates the  **document search and response generation** workflow within a RAG system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document Loading: Importing raw documents.  \n",
    "2. Text Chunking: Splitting text into manageable chunks.  \n",
    "3. Vector Embedding: Converting the text into numerical vectors using an embedding model.  \n",
    "4. Store in Vector Database: Storing the generated embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the query phase:\n",
    "- Steps: User Query → Embedding → Search in VectorStore → Relevant Chunks Retrieved → LLM Generates Response\n",
    "- The user's query is transformed into an embedding vector using an embedding model.\n",
    "- This query embedding is compared against stored document vectors within the vector database to **retrieve the most relevant results**.\n",
    "- The retrieved chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a final response based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to explore and optimize the VectorStore → Relevant Chunks Retrieved → LLM Generates Response stages. It will cover advanced retrieval techniques to improve the accuracy and relevance of the responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** search method is a document retrieval algorithm designed to reduce redundancy by balancing relevance and diversity when returning results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How MMR Works:**\n",
    "Unlike basic similarity-based searches that return the most relevant documents based solely on similarity scores, MMR considers two critical factors:\n",
    "1. Relevance: Measures how closely the document matches the user's query.\n",
    "2. Diversity: Ensures the retrieved documents are distinct from each other to avoid repetitive results.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Key Parameters:**\n",
    "- `search_type=\"mmr\"`: Activates the MMR retrieval strategy.  \n",
    "- `k`: The number of documents returned after applying diversity filtering(default: `4`).  \n",
    "- `fetch_k`: Number of documents initially retrieved before applying diversity filtering (default: `20`).  \n",
    "- `lambda_mult`: Diversity control factor (`0 = max diversity` , `1 = max relevance` , default: `0.5`)."
