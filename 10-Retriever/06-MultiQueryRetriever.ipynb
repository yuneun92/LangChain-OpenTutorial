    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`MultiQueryRetriever` offers a thoughtful approach to improving distance-based vector database searches by generating diverse queries with the help of a Language Learning Model (LLM). This method simplifies the search process, minimizes the need for manual prompt adjustments, and aims to provide more nuanced and comprehensive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Distance-Based Vector Search**  \n",
    "  Distance-based vector search is a technique that identifies documents with embeddings similar to a query embedding based on their \"distance\" in high-dimensional space. However, subtle variations in query details or embedding representations can occasionally make it challenging to fully capture the intended meaning, which might affect the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamlined Prompt Tuning**  \n",
    "  MultiQueryRetriever reduces the complexity of prompt tuning by utilizing an LLM to automatically generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a single input. This helps minimize the effort required for manual adjustments or prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broader Document Retrieval**  \n",
    "  Each generated query is used to perform a search, and the unique documents retrieved from all queries are combined. This approach helps uncover a wider range of potentially relevant documents, increasing the chances of retrieving valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Search Robustness**  \n",
    "  By exploring a question from multiple perspectives through diverse queries, MultiQueryRetriever addresses some of the limitations of distance-based searches. This approach can better account for nuanced differences and deeper meanings in the data, leading to more contextually relevant and well-rounded results.\n",
