I will start with understanding all the knowledge of the world. Today, we will discuss a serious topic, which is currently about the issue of medical school quotas that have been causing some unrest. Although we refer to it as medical school quotas, it actually relates to our country’s healthcare environment, including the healthcare system and public health policies. 

Until now, there has been one area where we outshine the United States: their healthcare system is very expensive, while ours has been more cost-effective. This admiration for our system has been expressed by figures like Obama and Clinton. However, reflecting on this, I realize that our population structure used to be heavily skewed towards young people, resulting in fewer healthcare needs, and occasionally older patients would show up, which made it seem like a lighter burden.

Now, as our cost structure is facing issues, it has become a matter for everyone to think about collectively. We are providing opportunities for those with opinions to speak up. We have government officials and doctors joining us, and today we want to hear different perspectives rather than repeating past discussions. A student raised their hand saying they wanted to discuss different topics, and we invite them to do so.

Today, we are welcoming a renowned professor from Seoul Asan Hospital, Professor Jung Hee-won, who has introduced the concept of geriatrics in our country. Thank you for joining us, Professor Jung. You mentioned you have some thoughts you have been keeping to yourself, and you are here to share those today.

While various media outlets have invited me recently, they often preferred to discuss topics that sell better and not the issues I deeply want to address. However, even if the content isn’t commercially viable, if it serves the society's needs, we believe it is necessary to share those voices.

You refer to the issue as the "elephant in the room," which is a metaphor for a problem that everyone acknowledges exists but prefers to avoid discussing. Although everyone recognizes this elephant and considers it a problem, they wish to steer clear of talking about it, fearing backlash.

So, the topic I will be discussing today is actually not very popular. First of all, I work at Seoul Asan Medical Center in the Department of Internal Medicine, and I have a somewhat different perspective, which is my personal opinion. This is not the official stance of Seoul Asan Medical Center, nor is it necessarily the opinion of internal medicine specialists or the internal medicine association; it's just my individual view. I would appreciate it if you could listen without any burden.

As you can see in the picture, I am talking about a topic that is not very popular and may be uncomfortable. I will be delving into a more complex discussion. First, I'd like to ask the representative, Mr. Ahn, and Mr. Pro, what they believe constitutes good medical care. What do you hope for in terms of healthcare in our country? The best healthcare?

In my opinion, good healthcare has two aspects: first, no one should be unable to receive treatment due to the cost of medical expenses. Second, if a disease can be treated in another country, I hope there aren’t any issues with facilities or the introduction of new drugs that prevent us from treating it here. So, first and foremost, it has to be affordable, and second, it should have high performance and good value for money. That’s not easy, and I feel like I might be called out for that. Mr. Ahn, do you have similar thoughts?

I think I am similar in that aspect, but I intentionally avoid answering loaded questions. People can be quite cowardly that way, right? No, I’ve actually been responding more these days. Even if I’m not living my life splendidly, I strive not to live it cowardly. So, I would also say it should be affordable, high-performing, and quicker outcomes would be even better.

Now, if you could display the screen for me. I believe that our country’s healthcare has performed extraordinarily well so far. We've achieved nearly the highest level of healthy life expectancy and overall longevity in the world. Interestingly, Korea and Japan are the countries with the longest and healthiest lifespans globally, yet the perception of one’s own health status is among the lowest in the world. It ranks the lowest among OECD countries. That is quite peculiar.

I think this relates to what I will discuss today regarding the concept known as the "Red Queen" effect. This idea comes from Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass," where the Red Queen states that to stay in the same place, one must run very fast, and to get somewhere else, one must run at least twice as fast. It may seem out of the blue, but this relates to evolutionary theory, which offers various insights on such matters.

Ultimately, as competition becomes infinite, individuals must continuously improve themselves just to maintain their position. This brings to mind the metaphor of the Red Queen, and I will also present the metaphor of universal welfare versus selective welfare. This is an analogy. What this means is that the reason South Korea's healthcare system has become one of the cheapest in the world with a vast amount of services enjoyed, as mentioned by the professor, can be illustrated by the Red Queen metaphor. In this context, medical fees are often raised and new medical technologies, such as robotic surgery, are introduced, and these efforts are perpetually pursued by various medical societies and departments. 

This is because, fundamentally, in South Korea, the basic examination fees and the fundamental costs associated with admitting a patient are very low. Therefore, to stimulate growth in this area, it becomes necessary to continuously introduce new technologies. As comprehensive hospitals and advanced general hospitals adopt these technologies, the service competition intensifies, leading to progressively lower prices. Consequently, for example, South Korea offers robotic surgeries at the most affordable rates in the world. 

However, there are issues that come with this. For instance, if a specific triggering event or social issue arises, or if there is involvement in a presidential campaign, the fees associated with certain medical services can rise specifically for those affected. For example, in the current conversation around essential medical practices, it has been indicated that certain departments like obstetrics and surgery will see their fees increased for specified procedures or codes, especially if such influences have gained traction in the medical community during the previous government. 

There was a system that linked dementia care reimbursements, and under "Mooncare," certain imaging tests saw fee increases. This leads to what can be recalled as the "enclosure movement," essentially a form of privatization. In a similar vein, fees that pertain to specific factions or procedures can potentially increase, while the fee-for-service model creates a scenario where the reimbursement rates for certain tests or procedures also rise. This ultimately results in a zero-sum game, meaning that if there is an increase in reimbursement for certain medical services or tests, the basic examination fees will likely see less increase. 

In conclusion, while the overall budget is fixed, and the allocation of funds is predetermined, when a particular area receives a boost—often due to the pressures from stakeholders advocating for fee increases—this will result in reductions elsewhere, or at least a slower pace of increase in other areas. I will present this with data shortly. While it is rare for fee reductions to occur, there can be instances where the commercialization and widespread adoption of a procedure lead to smaller reimbursements over time. However, the basic examination fees have not typically seen cuts. Consequently, as health insurance premiums gradually rise each year, the question arises as to where to allocate this increase, which often gravitates toward departments that attract significant political attention. 

Therefore, when we request increases in the fees for essential departments, there is often a dialogue around these topics. I personally think that historically, the resolution to such issues has continually ended with merely raising fees, which I believe has not been helpful. To say that fee increases don't yield beneficial results is rooted in the metaphor of Alice in Wonderland, illustrating the endless cycle of competition depicted as the Red Queen's game. In the scheme shown, the departments that benefit from fee increases primarily consist of large hospitals and the incentives they receive may be significantly lower when compared to their overall revenue increases. The increase in fees for services like MRI can translate to minimal personal incentives for the physicians involved, meaning small compensations for increased workload, which can lead to shifts in residency interest towards more lucrative specialties.

It seems that there is a significant disparity in the healthcare system, particularly regarding the compensation for different medical specialties. As more departments receive increases in fees, the ones that have historically been undercompensated, like pediatrics and family medicine, begin to suffer due to a drop in consulting fees. This creates a vicious cycle, where the hospitals that already have lower patient volumes struggle to maintain their surgical teams and capabilities. Consequently, the influence and bargaining power of these departments diminish, which means less political power and further reductions in their compensation.

In regions with low patient volumes, simply raising the fees will not solve the problems facing local healthcare. There has been a notable shift where large hospitals benefit the most, like the top five hospitals in Seoul, which receive the most compensation due to their capacity for high volumes of procedures and advanced equipment. In contrast, local hospitals may struggle due to their lower operational scales, which hampers their ability to perform surgeries effectively.

Moreover, the historical compensation for medical consulting has not kept pace with inflation. From 1980 to 2024, the initial consultation fee has increased modestly compared to the price of everyday goods like food, which reflects the broader economic situation where medical professionals' compensation has not risen adequately. 

The issue of healthcare compensation appears to stem from a system that undervalues human labor relative to equipment costs. There is a concern among bureaucrats that increasing consultation fees could result in doctors spending less time with patients, leading to a superficial approach to care. The idea of adjusting fees based on patient volume is proposed to create a balanced system where doctors are compensated fairly while still spending adequate time with each patient.

Finally, the speaker points to the need for discussions on solutions inspired by best practices from other OECD countries, emphasizing that this issue is not merely about increasing fees but also how to create a sustainable healthcare system that supports both urban and rural healthcare providers equally.

It is necessary to reference how the OECD average is performing. Ultimately, this discussion originates from the Korean Medical Association’s Medical Policy Research Institute. In conclusion, the more detailed time spent with patients could result in needing an increase in payment based on time. Let me start by discussing the OECD standards first. Now, I should mention something called medical shrinkflation, which I will explain later. Essentially, shrinkflation occurs because of the lack of value for patients, leading to situations such as open runs in pediatrics and one-minute consultations at tertiary hospitals. This shrinkflation mirrors regular inflation in which, for example, the price of a snack cannot be raised, so companies reduce its size, effectively 'shrinking' its contents.

In our case, a lack of sufficient examination time leads to brief consultations. When I was training as a resident or studying in medical school, internal medicine professors would typically prescribe comprehensive treatments and spend considerable time with patients. However, at some point, it became a trend for internal medicine specialists to only focus on specific diseases, referring patients with chronic illnesses like hypertension or diabetes to specialized doctors. Only 15 to 20 years ago, patients were not even referred within the internal medicine department. 

This specialization has grown, but it is directly related to the issue of inadequate consultation fees and the elimination of special examination fees. From the perspective of tertiary hospitals, in order to break even, professors must reduce consultation times progressively, leading to more mechanized and algorithm-driven medical practices. I will elaborate on the results of this later. If we resolve this issue, we could reach the OECD average. Currently, consultation fees in South Korea are about one-fourth of the OECD average. If those fees became normalized and examination costs were reduced, the outpatient consultation volume could decrease to one-third. This way, patients would be recognized as individuals again, and more integrated care would be provided.

As the population ages, the concept of needing more doctors becomes unnecessary because, according to the WHO, as the elderly population increases, primary care physicians become increasingly essential to manage numerous illnesses holistically. However, in South Korea, we are currently reversing this approach. Although increasing the time doctors spend with patients might reduce the number of patients they can see, the already present backlog means that patients often have to wait indefinitely for their appointments.

In the UK, this problem exists — it’s not that the total number of patients decreases, but the number of patients that can be managed effectively does. I also have evidence to support this; please show the slide. As mentioned, the number of outpatient visits in South Korea is almost three times higher than the OECD average. While Korea is now aging similarly to the OECD average, it has historically been a younger country. Despite this, we still have high outpatient visit rates, extended hospitalization durations, and the fastest growing healthcare costs in the OECD.

So, are there actually a lot of clinical doctors in our system? If we look at the numbers like 3.7 or 2.0, they may seem low; however, these doctors are conducting an enormous amount of medical practices with relatively few members. This reveals a zero-sum nature: spending three times the amount of time while treating only one-third of the patients can lead to OECD average outcomes. Consequently, with our current resources, we are already in a state where we can maintain sufficient supply.

So what has resulted from this undervaluation of patient care? Here is a list of prescriptions from a patient who visited me. Upon examining this list, it becomes apparent that it reflects the consultations of multiple doctors: one doctor, two doctors, three doctors, four doctors, five doctors, six doctors, and seven doctors.

The discussion emphasizes the overuse of medication and the lack of a well-established primary care system in Korea, which leads to excessive healthcare consumption, particularly among elderly patients. Many patients take numerous medications and frequent multiple specialists, resulting in fragmented care and reduced quality of individual treatments. This situation is exacerbated by the increasing number of hospital beds and a focus on acute care, with projections suggesting that if the aging population continues on its current trajectory, the system may struggle to cope with the demand for care in the future.

Moreover, the commentary points out the necessity for more primary care physicians who can coordinate treatments and manage patients' overall health rather than just focusing on diseases. As people age, they tend to have more health issues, and the healthcare system often treats each condition separately without considering holistic care or prevention. This eventually leads to extensive and sometimes unnecessary treatments that can worsen patient conditions, such as falls and medication side effects.

The discussion also highlights the importance of implementing a care model that prioritizes patient quality of life over disease treatment—emphasizing roles such as supportive care and preventive measures, which many countries, like Japan and Taiwan, already have in place. In contrast, Korea's system needs a reevaluation to recognize the significance of primary care in managing the health of the elderly, prioritizing preventive care and proper management of chronic conditions to enhance their quality of life.

I would like to talk about what hospitals are thinking in the current situation. In fact, this slide is brought up to target Professor Kim Yun. The assumption that increasing the number of doctors will lower the average salary per doctor and that vital departments will have more doctors is incorrect. It's also incorrect to think that raising compensation will help because, as I mentioned earlier, departments that incur losses continue to lose money. Therefore, raising compensation indiscriminately doesn't make sense. If we drop doctors' salaries, will the number of essential care or vital department physicians increase? No. For example, Professor Kim Yun mentioned that a specialist earns 400 million won at the age of 35. When I became a 35-year-old resident, my salary was 4.5 million won a month. In September 2023, I became a contract professor with a salary of 10.1 million won after 9 years of being a specialist. The issue is that the economic damage caused to my hospital due to my position exceeds my salary. 

This loss is because my department is in the red. When I provide patient care focused on consultations, evaluations, or coordinating home care instead of referring them to nursing hospitals, the financial loss is greater than my salary. From the hospital's perspective, this is a matter of resource allocation, leading to reduced positions in essential departments. Although we don't consider ourselves essential, there are fewer positions in departments that don't generate revenue, like pediatrics and internal medicine.

It’s common to see residents in these less popular fields waiting for years to become professors. I also experienced a long period as a free agent. Even if we suddenly recruited 20,000 more doctors, for instance, Seoul Asan Hospital has a minimal amount of data due to its internal structure, while Seoul National University Hospital lacks certain departments entirely. 

Interestingly, healthcare is about spending money; however, those running the healthcare system believe they need to earn money. In public hospitals, when creating positions for individual professors or specialists, decisions are made based on how much revenue they can generate. This depends largely on examination fees. So, most departments, especially those incurring losses, end up losing money. 

You might ask why losses occur even when professors’ salaries are paid. There are additional expenses for maintaining examination rooms or other facilities. There’s also the opportunity cost: if space is allocated to numbers-generating departments, they could earn even more, leading to utility costs like water and electricity. I’m not the only doctor; there are nurses, administrative staff, and other management involved, which incurs significant operational costs. Therefore, I believe we need to introduce some concept of medical public goods.  

Ultimately, it becomes a zero-sum game. The public insurance system sets certain reimbursement rates based on the importance assigned to specific diseases, like increasing compensation for cardiovascular diseases or classifying dementia as a severe illness. As a result, if other areas lose out, the better-earning departments must help cover those losses. However, from a hospital management perspective, they may question why they should hire people generating losses, leading to fewer positions available. In essential fields, there are not many slots available. Consequently, even if one wants to practice in vital departments, there are no positions, causing many to shift to other specializations. This is especially true for fields like thoracic surgery, where many professors find that due to insufficient patient volumes, they can’t maintain their teams and end up shifting to less complex procedures, leading to a vicious cycle, as is the case in general hospitals.

In the field of cardiothoracic surgery, there has been a gradual decline in demand for cardiac surgeons, leading to fewer residents entering the field. Even those who complete fellowships increasingly pursue other careers afterward. This isn't due to a lack of patients, as the patient population remains stable, but rather because the financial compensation available from those patients is limited. This can result in hospitals reducing the number of positions. 

Additionally, in fields like pediatrics, discussions indicate that the number of patients has significantly decreased, even though the number of pediatricians remains similar. There is a shrinking "pie" of patients available for treatment; moreover, if certain conditions can be treated through procedures or medication rather than surgery, surgeons may face decreasing volumes of patients. 

In some specialties, such as mine, I might see an increased patient volume yearly, but financial losses do not decrease. Private hospitals might not create positions in fields like family medicine due to the lower revenue they generate. Though doctors in high-revenue specialties may earn substantially more than those in public hospitals, the disparity remains. 

The core issue rests in how the medical fee structure is regulated politically, which can adversely affect the sustainability of practices. Doctors may find themselves compelled to leave academia for private practice due to better compensation. However, if fees increase, the concern arises that some will transition to private practice, thus hollowing out academic hospitals. 

If, for instance, there are reforms or adjustments made to improve the income of geriatric departments because of perceived losses, it's crucial to assess and validate those claims with data. Different geographic locations might experience various financial outcomes, and solutions should be tailored accordingly.

The healthcare system is experiencing problematic wealth distribution and resource allocation. I find myself working excessive hours (approximately 103 this week) without the protection provided to residents, leading to substantial underpayment conditions. Government policies dismissing our resignation as illegal provide little incentive for positive change, while others promoting fee increases often overlook foundational problems. Ultimately, this creates a concern about who will remain in the field, complicating the problem of maintaining vital healthcare services. Individuals may question the necessity of their roles when facing such injustices in the current healthcare system.

First of all, I will provide a detailed answer regarding this. If you could briefly show the slides, I would like to take a look at them first before giving my final response. What I'm discussing here is the distribution issue within the healthcare sector, particularly concerning university hospitals. In conclusion, while we often hear that university hospitals are struggling, there is evidence that they are not as financially troubled as claimed. They can manage their accounting in a certain way. For instance, they can set aside funds as reserves because they might anticipate future deficits, allowing them to treat those funds as expenses. If we exclude reserves and losses from consideration, we can see that for a hospital like Seoul National University Hospital, its self-owned capital has increased by around 600 billion won over two years, despite reporting continuous deficits. Although they claim to be running at a loss, they have accumulated 600 billion won. This scenario may reflect a form of gaslighting experienced by doctors in the past.

However, the reserves cannot just be withdrawn freely; they are typically a certain percentage of annual sales. If financial conditions worsen, those reserves would be affected. Historically, hospitals with a record of losses tend to hold more reserves, whereas a hospital like Seoul National University, which has not experienced a significant drop in patients, could afford to set aside fewer reserves. Nevertheless, there appears to be no obligation for these hospitals to disclose how these reserves are utilized, which creates a notable accounting loophole.

Consequently, it could be argued that tertiary hospitals are overestimating their costs. This is merely my personal opinion and not connected to Seoul National University Hospital, and I worry that this could have repercussion for me within the hospital. In practice, elderly patients who visit our facility often struggle to navigate multiple departments for their various ailments, leading to a less than satisfactory experience. Moreover, it costs around 500,000 won for just one day of hospitalization, often in uncomfortable conditions, and patients may wait for three hours to receive just a minute of consultation. Everyone involved faces discomfort, including doctors who feel overwhelmed caring for 100 outpatient cases, and meanwhile, there is a shortage of physicians in the regions.

As mentioned by the previous speaker, something like differentiated medical fees might be necessary. The bureaucratic perspective tends to think that even if consultation fees are increased, the consultation time will still only last one minute. Furthermore, as pointed out by the previous speaker, political forces are most resistant to the idea of providing financial incentives for local patients receiving care in their vicinity, as it would entail additional subsidies for rural areas and could potentially increase national health insurance premiums, something that all parties oppose.

For rural healthcare to thrive, it’s essential to create sufficient incentives to keep patients local and develop local centers into comprehensive facilities that can accommodate higher volumes. This approach would require reviving historical consultation regions, which political entities are likely to resist. For instance, after the introduction of SRT and KTX, encouraging local residents to use rural medical facilities would also face significant opposition. Additionally, arbitrary postings of Seoul's physicians to rural areas would not be feasible, nor could any financial penalties be applied. 

Furthermore, incentivizing rural healthcare practitioners financially could lead to increased health insurance premiums, which is also politically unpalatable. In reality, if rural facilities face deficits, it’s likely they would close down. Ultimately, hospitals may find themselves competing in a 'Red Queen's race' for survival. If certain specialties gain higher payments, it could indirectly benefit these hospitals, resulting in increased incentives for individual practitioners, while clinicians like myself end up caught in the middle, experiencing the pressures of both sides without stepping into the shoes of patients directly.

I apologize for using the term "prezzlista", but in a way, it reflects the discussions we have where the comfortable decision-making of bureaucrats in positions 1 and 2 is aided by tailored consulting opinions that are mainly presented by those who appear on TV. When I express my desire to discuss these matters on KBS, I am told it might be difficult. Moreover, healthcare consumers who engage in medical shopping through cherry-picking the system can also be seen as accomplices. All of this has led us to enjoying the highest rate of rise in medical expenses among OECD countries and the highest frequency of medical usage. As the professor mentioned, we are receiving affordable, high-quality care, a situation made possible largely due to South Korea being a relatively young nation. However, as the population ages and the number of elderly patients increases, maintaining this level of care will not be easy.

Lastly, I would like to point out that when we engage in fragmented adult semi-urgent care, we will perpetually need more doctors. Currently, we lack three critical concepts: the idea of primary care, the concept of a primary physician for elderly patients, and the preventive care model practiced in Japan. This results in a healthcare desert. Fragmented healthcare works well for younger individuals, but for the elderly who are frail, if we provide them with care identical to younger patients, they may not even be able to walk home. It’s essential to offer an entirely different advanced country model tailored specifically for them, yet such discussions are scarcely held in our country.

These points reflect an OECD primary care model or an average WHO primary care model that many have yet to discuss, as they continue to maintain the current system while expanding indefinitely—looking to increase hospital beds and the number of doctors, yet ultimately aiming to reduce physicians' salaries by flooding the supply of doctors. However, even if they increase medical school admissions by 2,000, after five years, only about 10,000 doctors will emerge, which constitutes less than a 10% increase in a total of 140,000 doctors—a fact that suggests this is not a practical solution.

Fundamental reforms are necessary, yet no one appears to be willing to discuss them. Many people dislike the idea of taking bitter medicine, and when speaking with bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the situation is somewhat disheartening. The systems from the 1990s and 2000s were pieced together haphazardly. There is a prevalent belief that the currently fragmented, specialist-oriented treatment system has been a significant tradition since the Goryeo dynasty, which isn’t accurate. There's need for a shift towards a more integrated approach, following advanced country models, but many people remain entrenched in silo structures and path dependence.

To conclude, I want to share an experience from ten years ago in 2014 when I was a fourth-year resident. During a retirement lecture by a respected professor, he showcased an image related to a significant accident resulting from accumulated negligence and a disregard for safety. He stated that in South Korea, if a physician spends time examining and consulting with a patient, they can arrive at a diagnosis roughly 80% of the time. However, the process has shifted toward a reliance on quick assessments via monitors with patients engaging in doctor shopping, which encourages unnecessary medical examinations. He predicted that in ten years, this would lead to situations akin to that of the Iriko incident for Korean healthcare. 

Recently, as I prepared this presentation, I noticed that the current healthcare access for patients in need is diminishing. Many individuals find it difficult to find a physician who listens to them, leading them to continually seek healthcare services whenever symptoms arise, resulting in increased healthcare utilization. Consequently, patients incur higher medical costs, leading to dissatisfaction across the board. Individuals travel to Seoul and wait for hours only to meet their physician for just a minute.

Regarding the recent changes in the healthcare payment system proposed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, they suggest shifting from a fee-for-service model to something more integrative, like a public policy-based pricing model, hospital-specific pricing, or a broad allocation for particularly necessary fields. Wouldn’t this represent a bit of a change? 

Yes, but these adjustments are relatively minor, with pilot models being very limited in scope. For instance, money planned for thorough patient assessments falls short, while the expenditure on certain medications, like brain nutrient supplements, which are prescribed as specialty drugs, reaches around a trillion won annually. 

This implies that while funds are not allocated toward preventive measures or reducing unnecessary healthcare costs, the spending on treatments and medications skyrockets, often hundreds of times higher in comparison. In Japan, extensive budgets are used to prevent seniors from declining into a state that requires care by investing in their functional abilities. In South Korea, this preventive concept is largely absent, and physicians cannot prescribe such preventive measures effectively.

Since there is nothing I can prescribe, I can't receive any fees for services. I need to enable the ability to prescribe those treatments. Originally, I would tell the Ministry of Health that all education relating to consultation fees must be included. When advising patients to exercise, isn't it just verbal advice? So I perform exercise education for 20-30 minutes in the consultation room, for example, receiving around 27,000 won for a first visit consultation at our hospital, which essentially balances things out. Doctors can give verbal advice, improve lifestyle habits, and promote prevention, but in South Korea, we aren't moving in that direction. In short, due to a lack of value for personnel, the tendency is to hastily prescribe brain nutrient supplements, which creates a vicious cycle.

The concept of fee-per-service needs a fundamental change. It's not just about increasing the amount of fees; we need to reframe the way we think about these fees. Currently, payment is strictly linked to performing specific actions. If you tell patients not to do certain things, you won’t receive fees. Under this large umbrella of healthcare—which includes not just treatment but also future welfare connections and prevention—we need to reconsider how we utilize and engage healthcare to ensure people's health.

Currently, treatment, particularly diagnostic tests and prescriptions, takes precedence, leading to a situation where more volume must continually be delivered. This has created "shrinking inflation," causing many people to engage in a harmful competition to provide services, ultimately distorting the compensation system. A small minority might benefit from these distortions, but most citizens, including essential healthcare providers especially in rural areas, end up suffering. 

Listening to this, I realize that the supply and demand in our country's healthcare system is quite similar to that in private education. It feels endless; there seems no need to study to such an extent, but competition pushes people into it—sending children to jump rope academies or solving Japanese math problems. In education, there's another reason for doing just the basics rather than over-studying, while in healthcare, we should systematically address only the necessary services, yet we've failed to establish such a framework. With patients wandering from clinic to clinic, seeking various consultations, a vicious cycle is perpetuated.

Fundamentally, we can reduce healthcare demand significantly. If a patient first visits a family medicine clinic and follows the doctor's recommendations, healthcare demand can be managed better. We need to adopt systems from abroad to ensure patients do not freely navigate from place to place without guidance. Simply raising the fee structure or increasing the number of doctors isn't the solution.

Is this related to profitability concerns in pharmaceutical or healthcare industries? I don't think so. I initially considered this but found that South Korea has some of the lowest drug prices worldwide. For instance, diabetes medications can be up to 20 times cheaper here compared to the U.S. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to sell drugs at government-set prices. This isn't about a corporate conspiracy but reflects the reality that we must supply affordable care while navigating unappealing solutions. The ongoing aging population and increasing healthcare demands have forced us to expand supply, leading to the current problems.

Looking back, it's worth investigating who introduced the country's real insurance policy and the person who authorized it at the financial regulatory commission. Implementing such a system under these conditions raises questions. Overall, there seems to be a consensus among various stakeholders—including government officials and physicians—that healthcare demand must be reduced and that there is an excess of services available.

However, I believe that realistically reducing medical demand is possible for those in rural areas. In Seoul, general hospitals are overrun, right? Patients would likely go to tertiary hospitals in places like Busan or Gyeongbuk. No matter how sick someone is in the countryside, they wouldn’t be sent to Seoul Asan Medical Center, would they? But in the current situation, if that is to happen, the level of medical personnel must be standardized for it to be accepted. At the very least, there should be a systematic rotation for doctors so that a patient, who has only one life, would not have to go to a doctor who performs surgery only twice a year while the other doctor performs 100 surgeries a year. Surely, they wouldn’t want to be a guinea pig under these circumstances, saying, "Come here, and in 10 years, the doctor you see next will be someone who performs about 50 surgeries." This means it's difficult to implement immediately, and rightly so. However, in order to achieve this, vital physicians must be retained in rural areas, requiring the government to increase the number of doctors and potentially provide financial incentives for these vital doctors. 

The issue of salary is relative. If all doctors nationwide are paid 2 million won a month, then paying vital doctors around 1.5 million won might keep them, but when many private practitioners earn between 3 million to 5 million won, even paying someone a million won wouldn’t be satisfactory. Vital doctors are struggling financially not because they cannot work; rather, the discrepancy in earnings is the issue. The logic that needs to be addressed is why the income of outside private practitioners, particularly in cosmetic surgery and other non-covered medical areas, should be lowered to allow for better distribution of essential and rural healthcare. Even if the number of medical students were increased, it seems unlikely that the income of those in non-covered services would decrease significantly.

Currently, there are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 such practitioners, which is not a large number, and might not lead to an oversaturation of the market that could trigger a price competition among them. Ultimately, based on the current situation and what I've shown earlier, the newly added doctors would likely end up filling positions in hospitals, leading to a decline in rural healthcare. In my interpretation, increasing the number of doctors by 2,000 is not sufficient; even increasing by 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 may not yield any progress. The impact of numbers—0, 2,000, or 4,000—could be minimal in terms of essential and rural healthcare provision.

As I mentioned, the ultimate solution requires a new perspective in healthcare. It is crucial to establish positions rather than just relying on those who are financially well-off to create opportunities for others. However, currently, there is no incentive for hospitals to establish these positions that would generate opportunities for regional doctors.

Someone asked, “If the difference between increasing by 2,000, 3,000, or not increasing at all is negligible, what’s the reason to oppose an increase?” To this, I must clarify that my intention today is not to discuss the increase of medical student admissions but rather to illustrate the underlying conditions that need attention. The fundamental issues include the value placed on healthcare professionals and distribution disparities within the medical system, which ultimately prevent the creation of necessary positions.

For example, if I were to revise my approach, the advice I receive suggests prioritizing immediate profit over effective healthcare practices. This compels many healthcare providers to focus on generating revenue through selling expensive treatments and unnecessary tests due to the existing healthcare structure, which is driven by financial gain rather than patient care.

Thus, the increased number of medical professionals will not change the situation unless there is a significant transformation in the healthcare environment. Rather than simply increasing numbers, we should redistribute the proportion of healthcare costs overall to appropriately compensate medical professionals.

I am repeating myself here. The issue is with the numerical standards. When starting a practice, one should see 100 patients, but if only 30 patients are seen and the quantity is adjusted, then as I mentioned earlier about the numerical standards, the income of someone seeing 30 patients and someone seeing 60 patients should not differ by double. Even if only 30 patients are seen, the income should not greatly differ from seeing 60 patients. For instance, if an injection is prescribed, it might cost 30,000 won, while without the prescription it might be 27,000 won. Overall, this system needs to be mixed and changed. However, it is true that practitioners may have different opinions, so I will refrain from offering my views on this.

If you could provide your thoughts, please. I understand that it places you in a difficult position. However, since you are sharing your vision for the future of healthcare, it is natural that there will be both doctors who suffer losses and those who benefit from it. If your comments make you reluctant to address the doctors who incur losses, it prevents them from voicing their opinions during policy discussions. Yes, that is correct; you need to share your insights. 

Until now, my point has been that I agree with the professor’s remarks. Essentially, if the costs of tests decrease and the costs associated with people increase, or if the fees for services decrease, it will naturally happen. The fundamental way to address this issue could be illustrated by mentioning... of course. To increase the average revenue per patient, introducing a battery of tests or listing new procedures as covered services in order to alleviate chronic deficits in certain departments has become widespread. 

Ultimately, what this means is that from the government’s perspective, there is a baseline level of deficits that they accept, and since doctors operate unethically, they will burden patients with unreimbursed costs to reduce part of those deficits. Thus, the government provides a reimbursement that offsets the deficits to some extent, which results in a vicious cycle. 

This vicious cycle involves bureaucrats always pushing each other to act first. The solution is not simply to raise the numerical standards indiscriminately, but rather to improve the inequities present in the system. 

Oh dear, I might end up annoyed by both sides today. This doesn’t seem to be a solution. Listening can indeed change opinions; one might discover unknown factors within their reasoning. This is a very complex and tangled issue. 

However, the direction of the numerical standards needs to change fundamentally, not just whether to raise or lower them. While increasing the same budget is important, if it continues to be mishandled, it wouldn’t matter if the budget is doubled or increased tenfold. Therefore, we need to rethink the direction. 

It is crucial to change the way health budgets are allocated and structured. That is indeed correct, and it has been comprehensively summarized. I believe that the system determining the numerical standards has been a problem. Starting from zero knowledge about the standards today during this one-hour explanation, I now realize that this is indeed an issue. I wonder why it hasn't been addressed until now. 

Why is it not happening? Changing things shouldn't be this hard. Is it really difficult?

Yes. Let's go back to the slides. Slide. Slide. Here we go. I mentioned path dependency. There is inertia. The systems and concepts established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare about 20 years ago continue to persist. This path dependency also includes the notion that healthcare is about treatment. The second vice-minister of the Ministry of Health and Welfare deals with medical treatment. The vice-minister is focused on healthcare. In the elderly phase, medical treatment should gradually taper off, while welfare needs to increase, and during this transition, preventive welfare is necessary, as well as preventive measures for younger people in healthcare. These aspects are actually very small parts of the bigger picture. As I mentioned earlier, when our country was younger, these issues were not problematic, but as we age, there is a need to blend these elements and introduce new concepts, which are still tied to the old system, and that presents a problem. Moreover, there are bureaucrats who are skeptical of doctors, and as mentioned by the professor, there are certain unpopular tasks that no one wants to handle. It appears that if the first vice-minister is focused on welfare and the second vice-minister on healthcare, the minister should oversee both areas, right? 

In my experience dealing with the Ministry of Welfare, I meet numerous individuals from the department individually. However, within that context, there are silos forming, and mutual communication and exchange of opinions are lacking. It seems that all people need to come together to discuss certain issues, but that is not happening effectively. Additionally, if more emphasis is placed on counseling and treatment, then tests, equipment, and treatments may be relatively deprioritized. For example, if a patient might need an MRI and a robotic surgery, deficits could arise in such situations. An MRI, once implemented, can be more cost-effective if the number of tests conducted increases, as the cost per scan decreases with higher volumes. Therefore, the argument for more frequent scans can make sense.

So, the first point I want to make is that there is a tilt in the system. Secondly, within the healthcare system, there is a significant financial structure. If we cannot change the current landscape, we need to at least reconsider how to utilize this major financial resource. For example, expanding essential departments in public hospitals, maintaining teams even for those who are incurring losses, and creating TO (team organization) positions are necessary steps that are currently not being executed. For instance, people often suggest moving toward specialists, but doing so could cost approximately five times more, and that additional expense largely comes from personnel costs. These concepts need to undergo significant changes.

Alright, I think those who grasped the overall picture have done so. I'll stop here for today. However, there seems to be a conflict between the government and the doctors lately, with both sides trying to show their cards first. What you mentioned today indicates that regardless of which side shows their card first, a bigger challenge still lies ahead. So, it's crucial that whichever side addresses this issue should also prepare for the next, larger challenge. 

The comments section seems to have a negative atmosphere. No, no, it’s okay. This is about as good as it gets. Professor, these days, when a physician talks about medical policy on YouTube, the comments section can be quite harsh, but I think this is one of the cleaner spaces. Is that so? That's a relief. I consider it fortunate to be part of such a unique community.

Yes, thank you for listening. This is Professor Jeong Lee-hyung from Asan Medical Center in Seoul. We will not forget your courage, passion, and dedication in discussing difficult topics. Thank you. Hello, I am Dr. Ham Ik-byeong, a specialized dermatologist. It's nice to see you all again after two weeks. Initially, I had prepared materials to talk about warts with you today, but I felt that simply moving on would not be appropriate. So, I would like to discuss a different topic today. Please leave the slides up. You are likely seeing a lot about this in the news. The discussion in the media about increasing the number of medical school admissions to address the shortage of doctors is being reported as coming from the presidential office. The media seems to have seized the opportunity to state that there is a shortage of doctors and that we need to increase their numbers. Interestingly, even the Korean Medical Association, which strongly opposed the previous government’s plan to increase doctors by around 300, seems to be silent now. Why is that? Who are we supposed to increase the number of doctors for by 1,000 each year? 

If we look at OECD data, our country's number of doctors per capita is below average. What you see in the media is likely just that single piece of information. Is it true? Around two years ago, I remember broadcasting a three-part series arguing against the previous government's enforced vaccination policy for those under 18, stating statistically that it was unjustifiable and could harm patients due to the higher incidence of side effects. Holding that conviction, I now believe that the current government's plan to increase medical school admissions by 1,000 is not justified and is merely a populist claim ahead of elections, impracticable in reality, and could severely impact our future workforce distribution and the proportion of national medical expenses burdening the younger generations.

I plan to explain why the media's claims are incorrect by presenting OECD data. Next slide, please. If we have a shortage of doctors, it stands to reason that the quality of medical care our citizens receive would decline. It would be odd to say that healthcare quality improves amidst a shortage of practicing doctors.

Next slide. This is OECD data. The average number of doctors among the 38 OECD countries is 3.6 per 1,000 people. Greece has the highest at 6.2, followed by Austria at 5.3, with several other countries also above average. Many typical socialist countries also have a high number of doctors. It’s worth noting that the countries with the highest mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic are in this group, despite having many doctors. For example, the mortality rate in the UK at one point reached nearly 20%. South Korea, however, has only 2.55 doctors per 1,000 people, lower than the OECD average. Japan and the US also have around 2.6. Despite having fewer doctors, Korea's average mortality rate during the early stages of COVID-19 did not exceed 1%. 

So why is the level of medical care high in a country with fewer doctors? The countries listed as the top ten for the number of doctors often misrepresent actual healthcare quality levels. High average figures do not equate to skilled doctors, as seen in countries that have a high number of ill-equipped practitioners. However, when examining the numbers closely, the doctor-to-population ratios in Korea are similar to those of the US and Japan. This nuance is often neglected in discussions.

The number of doctors per 1,000 people in the United States, Japan, and South Korea is similar. If there truly was a shortage of doctors, it would be reasonable to increase their numbers, and few would oppose it. However, if there really was a shortage of doctors, the quality of our healthcare would decline, which would lead to a lower life expectancy for our citizens compared to the OECD average. Additionally, if there were fewer doctors, it would naturally be harder to see one, resulting in long wait times for healthcare services and lower usage rates of medical facilities. This would also lead to longer wait times for surgeries, and overall, the quality of medical care would drop, with the growth rate of doctors being relatively low compared to other countries.

If we examine the number of doctors in our country alongside the average lifespan, we see that the OECD average life expectancy is 81 years. South Korea ranks among the top countries with an average life expectancy of 83.3 years, alongside Japan, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy. In fact, countries with higher doctor-to-population ratios tend to have lower average life expectancies. For instance, Cuba has 5.9 doctors per 1,000 people but a life expectancy of only 79 years. North Korea has 3.3 doctors per 1,000 people with a life expectancy of 73 years.

Moreover, South Korea has seen the most significant increase in life expectancy from 1970 to 2019 among countries with fewer doctors. Our life expectancy is also much higher than the OECD average. Thus, the argument that the number of doctors needs to be increased based solely on OECD averages overlooks the financial implications for the country's healthcare system and represents typical populist policy.

If there were indeed a shortage of doctors, fewer people would be able to access hospitals. In my father's generation, it was common to hear stories of people not being able to afford medicine, leading to the deaths of elderly individuals. Nowadays, nearly 80% of deaths occur in hospitals in South Korea, which is unusual globally. Looking at healthcare usage, the OECD average for hospital visits per year is 6.8, while we have 17.2 visits—2.5 times more. If there truly was a shortage of doctors, it wouldn't make sense for individuals to visit the doctor so frequently, raising the question of how so many people can receive treatment if doctors are in limited supply.

The average hospitalization period in OECD countries is typically 7.6 days, while in our country, the average hospitalization period is 18 days. This means that after receiving treatment and recovering, patients usually get discharged around the time their surgical stitches are removed. In contrast, in OECD countries, where there are many doctors, patients are discharged after just 7 days, indicating a significant decline in functionality. Naturally, if there is a shortage of doctors, surgery wait times will be longer. 

An interesting statistic from OECD-data shows that the average percentage of patients waiting over three months for cataract surgery is 44%. The countries with many doctors have varying percentages of patients waiting over three months, ranging from 11% to 74%. In our country, it is unlikely that anyone waits to receive cataract surgery. In extreme cases, patients can schedule their surgery for the same day they make the appointment. Is there a shortage of ophthalmologists in our country? It seems quite strange, doesn’t it? 

Despite frequently hearing that our wait times are shorter than the OECD average, we live longer, receive surgeries faster, and can stay hospitalized longer. This curious situation could be attributed to the obsession with average numbers in the progressive healthcare discourse, which often emphasizes public healthcare.

Regarding hip replacement surgery, older individuals who suffer from avascular necrosis or injuries due to falls would need this major orthopedic surgery. The OECD average shows that 53% of patients wait over three months for hip joint replacement surgery. However, there are no statistics indicating that anyone in our country waits this long; the number is zero. Have you seen anyone waiting three months for hip surgery in our country? There may be rare cases where a patient chooses to consult with a renowned doctor at their own discretion and waits three months, but for most orthopedic surgeons at reputable hospitals, hip replacement surgeries can be performed within three days if the patient opts for it. 

In contrast, in countries with more doctors, the average percentage of patients waiting three months for surgery is 53%, yet there is no discussion about this. Instead, it is merely stated that there is a shortage of doctors. The average number of doctors per capita is noted as 3.6 in other countries compared to 2.5 in ours, leading to claims that we are one doctor short, emphasizing that we need to increase the number of doctors without considering these statistics. 

Additionally, the OECD average for those waiting over three months for knee replacement surgery is 64%, but in our country, the percentage is non-existent.

It's not reflected in the statistics. Why? We can receive all the treatment within a month or a week. Even though there are many shortages of doctors, we can still receive all the treatment within a month. That month is only for the patient's stability and for surgical preparation; there are no hospitals that make patients wait a month just because there aren’t enough doctors. If there were a true shortage of doctors in our country, how could we have a life expectancy that is 2.3 years higher than the OECD average and a relatively low mortality rate, especially post-operative mortality rate? We are 3.6 lower than the OECD average; Japan is 2.6 and we are 2.5. Japan and Korea, which have much lower numbers of doctors than the OECD average, have the lowest mortality rates in surgeries and treatments. How could such outcomes be possible if there was a true shortage of doctors? If the number of doctors in our country were insufficient, leading to a decline in the quality of healthcare, then what does the left graph indicate? The number of deaths due to preventable diseases is much lower in Korea than the OECD average. Preventability pertains not only to doctor-related issues but also to patient responsibility. For example, while quitting smoking can prevent lung cancer, a doctor cannot force someone to stop smoking. The real evidence showing the quality of doctors is the mortality rate from treatable illnesses. The left graph shows that the mortality rate from treatable diseases is 7.3% in the OECD average, whereas Korea stands at 4.2%. Switzerland, Korea, and Japan are in the top tier. Although Switzerland has a slightly higher number of doctors, both Japan and Korea have 2.5 and 2.6 doctors, which is below the OECD average. Discussing such data along with the number of doctors makes it reasonable to debate whether there is a shortage. The reason I mention the OECD is that I want to use their data as a framework for my discussion. For instance, the mortality rate of stroke patients in Korea is half that of the OECD average. Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland have the highest rates. A stroke is an urgent surgical case; prolonging surgery increases mortality rates and complications significantly, especially within the golden time of 8 to 12 hours. We have the best outcomes in this regard. If there is a shortage of doctors, how can we operate on stroke patients within 8 to 12 hours? What would supporters of the claim of a doctor shortage say about this data? In terms of cervical cancer treatment, Korea has the third-highest five-year survival rate in the world. If there were a shortage of doctors and they could not perform surgeries or treat properly, then the treatment rate would not be this high. Esophageal cancer, which has the worst prognosis, shows that Korea ranks second in survival rates in the OECD, following Japan. Our treatment outcomes are significantly better than the OECD average. If there were a shortage of doctors to perform surgeries, how could the treatment rate for esophageal cancer be so high? When I discuss these points, some might argue, “You’re a doctor; don’t you prefer to see an increase in the number of doctors?” Such statements do not align with the data. Personally, I am currently 63 years old as a doctor. In five to ten years at the shortest, I will no longer be able to practice medicine.

Due to various reasons, whether it be health issues or lack of physical strength, many might not pursue a career in medicine. Thus, even if the number of medical students increases now, it is unlikely that those additional students will impact my career or livelihood. Some commenters suggest that I am speaking for personal gain, but that is a mistaken notion. Others may argue that they have children, sons-in-law, or daughters-in-law who are doctors, but I regret to say that I have advised my children not to become doctors without a vision. Naturally, none of my direct descendants have become doctors. Therefore, whether the number of medical students increases or decreases does not affect my interests at all. I have simply worked in the medical field for a long time and want to share my experiences regarding how many doctors are appropriately needed in the future of South Korea, irrespective of any political agenda or economic benefit.

Currently, there is a proposal to increase the number of doctors by 1,000, which has stirred up a lot of interest from various political and media groups who typically have a vested interest in increasing the number of doctors. Next year's general election is on April 10. Look at the excellent treatment outcomes for esophageal cancer patients in South Korea, achieved by our surgeons. If there is a shortage of doctors, can this be possible? This is critical, and you need to pay attention to this.

Since the implementation of the medical service segregation policy in 2006, the number of medical schools was frozen at 3,058. This figure has not changed since then; for more than ten years, the number of doctors has remained the same. To suggest that the number of doctors has remained at 3,058 implies that those doctors work for a year and then disappear. Given the increasing life expectancy of the population, how long do you expect the careers of doctors to last? My medical license number is in the 30,000 range. Today's license numbers are in the six-figure range, indicating that the number of licensed doctors is continually increasing.

The OECD provides data showing this trend. I have cited data that my friend, former Korean Medical Association president Noh Hwan-kyu, compiled. The red line represents the average increase in the number of doctors across OECD countries. However, South Korea's graph shows that we have the most significant increase in the number of doctors among OECD countries, while the number of medical students has been frozen since 2006. The idea that we are stuck at 3,058 doctors reflects a misunderstanding, as it ignores the burgeoning number of licensed practitioners over the years. The freeze occurred around 2006, and those who focus solely on the number 3,058 are missing the bigger picture regarding the accumulation of doctors.

In 2006, the number of doctors and medical students did not increase. At that time, a fixed number of 3,058 physicians graduated each year. This consistent addition of 3,058 doctors led to an increase rate significantly higher than the OECD average. However, this aspect is not being discussed. One might think that an increase in the number of doctors would allow the entire population to access healthcare at much lower prices, but that is not necessarily the case, as I will explain later. The speed at which the number of doctors is increasing in South Korea is 2.6 times faster than the OECD average. This can be observed clearly in the data. In Japan, the number is not increasing as the Ministry of Health is trying to reduce it. The conclusion is that there is currently no shortage of doctors. In fact, if you visit new urban areas, you will find many medical buildings. You can see this even without going to a university hospital. 

When discussing this, some might say there are no doctors in rural areas. However, it's not just the absence of doctors in rural areas; there are also fewer people. In towns where the population is shrinking, there is no necessity to send doctors there. Even if it's a healthcare facility, attempting to maintain doctors in a small township would lead to much lower cost-effectiveness. There are underserved medical villages in rural areas, and to address that, the public health doctor system is in place to cover all of this. 

Some doctors who specialize in preventive medicine argue that there is a shortage of public health physicians. Although 3,058 doctors graduate each year, public health doctors are those who serve in rural areas as an alternative to military service. Doctors undergo 39 months of military service, which is more than twice as long as the average enlisted soldier. Out of the 3,058 graduates, the reason for the decrease in public health physicians is that half of the graduates are women. In the past, over 70% of medical students were men, whereas now the ratio is closer to half. In surgical fields, the male to female ratio is 1 to 1, which leads to a relative decrease in military personnel. Therefore, the lack of public health services is not due to a shortage of doctors but rather due to the decreased military resources. 

To address the shortage in public health services, women doctors could be sent to those positions, which would resolve the issue. This, however, may require changes to conscription laws, which is a different topic. In any case, there is no shortage of doctors. Furthermore, considering South Korea's small land size, the number of doctors per 10 square kilometers is sufficient compared to countries like the Netherlands and Israel. There is no necessity to have as many doctors as in larger countries because of the shorter distances in South Korea.

There are people who frequently mention the lack of doctors in rural areas, but when considering efficiency, there is likely no alternative to the public health system for deploying doctors up to a certain point. This is indeed the core of today's discussion. The number of doctors continues to rise, but why is there a shortage in essential medical fields? Let's analyze the reasons one by one. Looking at last year's results for residency recruitment, only about 60% of the positions in obstetrics and gynecology were filled, 20% in pediatrics, and 80% in emergency medicine. For thoracic surgery, it was only 30%. In contrast, popular fields like dermatology, which I practice, had a filling rate of 160%, and similar rates were seen in ophthalmology and plastic surgery at 160% and 170%, respectively. This is the reality. 

Of course, not all applicants are selected, as only the designated number is filled. The reason for the influx of applicants in dermatology can be traced back to the commercial medical practices I pioneered 30 years ago, such as laser clinics and cosmetic dermatology clinics. If I am criticized for setting a bad precedent, I cannot argue against that. However, when students enter medical school, their motivation to practice medicine is often not purely to serve society, as textbooks might suggest. In reality, students attend medical college largely because it offers a stable and lucrative career option. Why do top students across the nation all aspire to attend medical school? Is it solely to become a physician? Not at all. If we speak frankly, they pursue this path for the job security and the promise of a professional position that is unlikely to lead to layoffs.

Once they become medical students and graduate, what do they choose? They opt for fields that provide economic stability. Historically, these fields were neurology, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics. My seniors became licensed practitioners and managed to establish significant hospitals through their abilities. For example, Professor Lee Gil-yeo from Seoul National University was an obstetrician who built a hospital during his time. Other examples include hospitals established by general surgeons who later expanded into larger institutions. In the past, these major disciplines were lucrative despite their demands. Today, however, such success has become challenging due to various difficulties, limiting the ability to earn. As a result, fields like plastic surgery, ophthalmology, and dermatology—which can provide smaller, more manageable income—are attracting more students.

Due to the increasing number of students and graduates, certain medical specialties such as obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, thoracic medicine, neurosurgery, and orthopedics have started to become less attractive, even though they operate in areas where services are not fully covered by insurance. In the past, physicians in these fields, especially obstetricians and gynecologists, were able to gain significant financial benefits from their work, which allowed them to contribute back to society by funding universities. However, essential medical services are becoming increasingly challenging. Residents often face sleepless nights due to the demanding nature of the work, leading to high stress levels and inadequate financial compensation.

Moreover, medical practitioners now face legal consequences that are far more severe than in previous times, where most issues could be resolved civilly rather than criminally. For instance, in essential medical fields, healthcare providers are constantly on standby due to the life-or-death situations they handle, adding immense stress. Obstetricians, for example, must manage the lives of both the mother and the child simultaneously.

While these professionals once enjoyed substantial economic rewards, the revenue they generate now is barely enough to maintain their hospitals. As a result, fewer individuals are willing to pursue these demanding careers. Current medical students likely prefer more manageable jobs with sustainable income rather than taking on the stress of essential medical specialties.

The disparity is evident when comparing the number of treatments per physician; South Korea has approximately 6,900 to 7,000 treatments per person, significantly higher than the OECD average of 2,000. Despite this higher workload, South Korean physicians earn only about 1.5 times the OECD average salary. The country's hospital bed density is nearly three times the OECD average, reflecting the immense burden physicians face to manage this capacity without a proportional workforce. 

The healthcare system also sees non-essential fields, such as dermatology and plastic surgery, benefiting from the lack of insurance constraints, allowing for easier work and higher earnings. Proposals to increase the number of physicians significantly, by recruiting an additional 1,000 to 4,500 annually, fail to address why fewer doctors are choosing essential fields and whether new recruits will opt for these challenging specialties. 

Lastly, when discussing the fees for medical consultations, South Korea's initial examination fee is 15,310 KRW, much lower than in many countries, which discourages providers from seeking higher compensation for their expertise. For example, in the United States, the fee is around 120,000 KRW, while in France, it reaches 32,000 KRW. This contrast highlights the financial challenges facing South Korean healthcare professionals in comparison to their international counterparts, ultimately impacting patient access to care.

Even without going, just making a phone call costs $150. You will go broke. Now, South Korea has about 2.5 times more medical visits annually compared to the OECD average. How can we have this much medical care when there is a shortage of doctors? I don't understand why we say that the number of doctors is less by 2.5 compared to the 3.6 average. When looking at per capita medical expenditure, it is 83% of the OECD average. The total per capita medical expenditure in South Korea is among the lowest for treating diseases with high survival rates and short waiting times for surgeries, leading to good treatment outcomes and increased life expectancy. However, medical expenses are only 83% of the OECD average. All this data comes from OECD statistics, not from materials created by the Korean Medical Association. This means South Koreans are receiving good treatment for less money. Some people may challenge this statement, and I ask them to show me a country with better medical benefits than what we have in South Korea. I assert that there is none on Earth. No other country offers such medical benefits at this cost. If such a country exists, I can explain it all to you. There isn't one in our solar system, nor in our galaxy. Even searching the Andromeda galaxy, which is 2.5 million light-years away, you won't find a country with a better public healthcare system than ours at this cost. When comparing healthcare expenditure to GDP, it is only about half the OECD average. In conclusion, looking at overall medical expenses, we pay 83%, and when considering individual GDP, it's about 50%. Ultimately, South Korean citizens receive the most convenient healthcare system in the world while paying only around 50 to 80% of the OECD average costs, yet we still hear there is a shortage of doctors. I don’t understand. We utilize medical services over 2.5 times the OECD average, paying only 50% per person and 83% in total healthcare costs. This means, in terms of cost per visit, we are paying only about 25% of the OECD average. This information comes from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, which is often disliked by doctors because they reduce the fees claimed by doctors for insured patients across various categories. In 2006, this organization conducted an internal study on the analysis of medical costs. This was not done by a doctors' association but by the organization responsible for cutting costs for doctors. They found that the preservation rate of medical treatment costs was only 73.9%. This means they believe they are doing a great job by slashing costs. They released this data themselves, showing that they only provide 73.9% of the costs, and it reflects their performance. From a public perspective, it seems like they are doing well. For patients, since they are paying, it appears they are excelling at cutting costs.

In 2026, there is a hospital operated directly by the National Health Insurance, which has no precedent globally. Most of the staff at this Ilsan Hospital are alumni of Yonsei University. The University-Industry Cooperation Foundation conducted research to review the appropriateness of the cost calculation system and ways to enhance utilization. In simpler terms, it means they analyzed similar factors, and found that the average retention rate is only 69.6%, which is less than 70%. For comparison, university hospitals have an 84% retention rate, general hospitals have 75%, small clinics have 66%, and outpatient clinics only 62%. This indicates that we are doing quite well overall. The system manages to function despite these numbers.

However, doctors are only receiving 70-80% of the costs they are supposed to receive, which raises the question of why they continue working like this. They compensate for it through non-insured services. What do they use? They rely on advanced diagnostic equipment like CT, MRI, and PET scans. South Korea has significantly more of these machines than the OECD average because they can generate profit from them, even though they are not covered by insurance. In contrast, many individuals in countries like Norway and Sweden, where there is a high number of doctors, may go their whole lives without undergoing a CT scan. In Korea, on the other hand, nearly everyone undergoes MRI and CT scans, often for conditions where previously only an X-ray would suffice. This increase in diagnostic testing is primarily driven by the need for hospitals to sustain their operations and to avoid lawsuits.

As a result, medical expenses are continuously rising, and it is the health insurance management corporation that bears the cost—30% out-of-pocket for patients and 70% covered by the insurance fund. Consequently, this leads to annual increases in health insurance premiums for everyone.

In the past, fractures were treated effectively without performing CT or MRI scans. Nowadays, hospitals struggle to operate without these scans. They are often performed to prepare for potential medical lawsuits. Patients typically have insurance that covers these costs, leading them to request thorough checks for safety. However, the cumulative effect is that individuals end up paying 7.01% of their income towards medical insurance, which is likely to rise. This increasing expenditure primarily supports the MRI scans of fracture patients, which may not even be necessary.

There are also significant legal risks. A notable incident occurred at Ewha Womans University Medical Center around 2006 or 2007, involving a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where four premature infants died simultaneously. Although the cause was presumed to be sepsis, the medical staff—including doctors and residents—were arrested. Even if there had been negligence, it should have been a civil matter between the hospital and the patients' guardians, rather than resulting in criminal charges. After a lengthy trial that lasted five years, all healthcare workers involved were found not guilty.

The author believes that such legal actions reflect a prosecutorial trend to display tough approaches. The incident caused significant fear among medical professionals, leading to hesitation about pursuing careers in pediatrics or neonatal care due to the threat of becoming a target for similar prosecutions. In situations involving high mortality risks, it raises serious concerns about the willingness of new medical graduates to work in such critical areas. The fear of being handcuffed and taken for interrogation creates anxiety among those serving in the medical field, emphasizing how such threats affect their mental wellbeing and professional choices.

Recently, I've noticed that it seems like one can endure anything just by having power. However, doctors cannot do that. When they get handcuffed in the field and are embroiled in court battles for five years, would they want to stay in such a situation? At that time, what did the doctors say? They all mentioned that if this continues, there would be no residents in pediatrics. Even if they can't make money, there are quite a few doctors who genuinely love children and want to spend their lives in a profession caring for them. Because of those doctors, the pediatric department was still filled despite not making large money.

After reading the reports about the incident in 2016, it became clear that no one is applying to pediatrics anymore. I previously mentioned this situation, saying it shouldn't be happening. There should not be instances of doctors being handcuffed. But no one is listening. The media and the prosecution do not side with doctors; they refuse to hear this perspective. That's why there are no applicants. It's not that there are not enough handcuffs for doctors; it's because anyone who becomes a resident knows they will likely face high chances of being handcuffed. For the first and second year of residency, they have to spend six months in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. Who would want to do that? Surely not your children, right? 

There was an incident when an 8 or 9-year-old child came alone for treatment. The pediatrician needs to examine the child, but what can they do when a child that age arrives without a guardian? So, the doctor calls the guardian to come. The guardian, who works, explained they couldn't come immediately. Since it wasn't urgent, the doctor decided to send the child home until the guardian could come. However, the guardian reported this to the health center, and the doctor was subjected to cyberbullying on public forums. Eventually, the clinic's director had to close the practice. This is the reality for pediatric specialists in private practice. 

Who understands and represents the position of pediatricians working on the frontlines? Only other doctors can. In such circumstances, would anyone want to continue in that field? Many might prefer to go into dermatology or other specializations instead.

After about six months of learning from a friend about laser treatments, one can then pursue a career in dermatology. This is why there are no doctors in the field of essential medicine. Instead of the current annual quota of 1,000 new doctors, we should aim for 10,000. Currently, pediatricians are not being produced under this system. There’s no intention to change this system, and the idea that increasing the number of doctors would lead to a trickle-down effect benefiting pediatrics is unrealistic. If doctors are overwhelmed and unable to manage their studies, would you trust them with your children’s care? Similarly, this applies to obstetrics and gynecology. Doctors often express their feelings about the difficulties in these specialties. Although I felt relieved not to be in such a position, it also caused feelings of guilt and concern.

The system will not improve just by increasing the number of doctors to 1,000 or even 10,000; they will still not want to work in these essential fields. For example, in obstetrics, if a baby is stillborn, the delivery must be managed carefully to prevent maternal complications like sepsis. There are scenarios where complications arise, like placental abruption, which can lead to severe bleeding. In a critical moment, if the medical response isn’t flawless, lives can be lost. If a surgeon is held responsible for a mistake in such situations, they could face serious legal consequences, creating a reluctance to work in obstetrics.

In general surgery, two distinct issues are present. When a patient with a prior surgical history comes in with abdominal pain, the surgeon must quickly determine whether it necessitates surgical intervention or can be handled medically. This critical judgment is one of the first lessons taught during medical internships and in emergency departments.

This text discusses the challenges faced by medical practitioners, especially when distinguishing between surgical and medical problems. It explains that since they do not perform surgery or prescribe treatments themselves, they must communicate effectively with surgical colleagues. The author emphasizes that misjudgments in this process can lead to severe consequences, including emergency surgeries with poor outcomes. It mentions a situation where a surgical decision was questioned, leading to legal scrutiny. The legal system is described as taking on the responsibility to determine surgical indications in such cases, which may create complications for physicians.

The author shares an anecdote about a thoracic surgery case where significant lung tissue was removed due to a severe infection. Although this was deemed necessary, the patient later filed an 11 billion won lawsuit against the hospital, claiming that the surgery was performed without proper consent. Overall, the text reflects on the complexities of medical decision-making and the potential repercussions in both medical practice and the legal realm.

Is it correct to say "Kadoorik"? A ruling has been made for Kadoorik Academy and Seonggo Hospital to pay 1.1 billion won. The patient was lying down, and while the family was unreachable, their chest was opened up for surgery. The surgery was performed cleanly, and the patient is fine. The occupation of this patient would be truly unbelievable. I won't mention it to avoid any potential defamation claims, but you can search for it. If you type "Kadoorik medical school lung resection 1.1 billion," you'll find information about it. The job is quite peculiar. Would anyone want to become a thoracic surgeon under such circumstances? If the surgery cost 1.1 billion, that's one thing; if it cost 100 million, it might be different. For the procedure done well, the surgery cost would be around 10 million won. They performed the surgery successfully, and yet they had to pay 1.1 billion. Such incidents are happening frequently. So, would a doctor pursue that specialty? 

In fields like pediatrics, surgery, thoracic surgery, and emergency medicine, the rates of incidents are very high—20% in pediatrics, 50% in surgery, 30% in thoracic surgery, and 50-60% in emergency medicine. It doesn’t matter how many doctors are produced; they simply won’t pursue those fields. Some people naively believe that having more doctors will solve everything. They have a simplistic understanding of the complex, multidimensional reality. There are also some doctors who argue that if we increase the number of medical professionals in essential fields, they will overflow and move to non-essential areas. But would you want to entrust your health to someone who struggled academically and ended up in a non-essential medical field? 

These issues were discussed among our peers 20-30 years ago when outstanding surgical doctors were around. We used to say, "If you're in the hospital, you must suffer when you're sick. What can you do?" It's only now, after 20-30 years, that this has become a reality. There’s another problem: despite the increasing number of doctors, why is there a shortage in rural areas? Do we really have a shortage of doctors in the countryside? Relatively, regions like Gyeongbuk have a low population density compared to Seoul, meaning healthcare services are hard to provide everywhere, leading to a perceived shortage.

Let's look at OECD statistics for better insight.

Since you like OECD so much, let's look at the average doctor distribution ratio between urban and rural areas, which is 1.62 on average across OECD countries. In contrast, South Korea's ratio is 1.29, which is not bad. This indicates that there aren't many rural areas in South Korea where doctors are distributed sparsely. We should be discussing data like this as well. The reason why local healthcare continues to lag relatively is due to a severe concentration phenomenon. Why does this concentration occur? Since the introduction of the Moon Jae-in administration, healthcare coverage has been significantly strengthened, reducing out-of-pocket costs. In simpler terms, with strong coverage, even if you pay a small amount, your financial burden is minimal when visiting large, reputable hospitals. 

Moreover, private insurance plans such as "real insurance" have emerged, where costs might be covered at a ratio of 30:70, and for major diseases, it can be 95:5, resulting in out-of-pocket expenses between 5% to 30%. Even those expenses can often be fully covered by the real insurance. So, if I have no out-of-pocket costs, where would I want to go when I'm sick? Naturally, I'd want to go to the most expensive and esteemed hospital in South Korea. This is one reason why local healthcare struggles comparatively. 

In Seoul, there are five major hospitals—Seoul National University Hospital, Severance Hospital, Catholic University Hospital, Samsung Medical Center in Gangnam, and Asan Medical Center in the Gangdong area. These hospitals have facilities comparable to luxury hotels. Thus, the cost remains the same, but I pay nothing. Which hospital would I choose? Of course, I would go there. 

Additionally, the entire nation is connected within a three-hour distance via KTX. For instance, it only takes three hours to travel from Yeosu in Jeollanam-do or Changwon in Gyeongnam to Seoul. This creates a so-called “straw effect,” where patients from rural areas come to Seoul for diagnoses and surgeries, as the distance is not an issue. Once patients recover to a certain extent, they can continue outpatient treatment at home. Consequently, this straw effect leads to the concentration of hospitals in the metropolitan area. A similar effect happened with department stores, as seen with the famous Daegu department store, which has since closed down. People in Daegu who want to buy luxury goods go to Gangnam instead of their local department store.

There are these issues occurring, yet there are no doctors in rural areas. Will producing more doctors encourage them to go to rural areas? I don't think that will happen. Will it be a trickle-down effect? If so, will patients from Seoul, who would struggle to compete, utilize the services in rural areas? The medical delivery system appears well-structured on paper across the country, but it isn’t functioning effectively in reality. 

Additionally, there’s the issue of patients. In our country, there is a significant trend of seeking well-known doctors and famous specialists. This tendency leads to a situation where cancer patients immediately rush to Seoul for treatment upon diagnosis. This implies that surgeons in rural areas cannot perform surgeries. With the reinforcement of negative aspects in the care system, patients' financial burden has decreased, leading them to utilize their primary hospitals more. 

Research shows that 65% of people are using local clinics, 22% are using hospitals, and 11% are utilizing central or university hospitals. However, when asked if they have the intention to switch to local clinics, there’s no desire to do so. More people are inclined to switch to hospitals, with nearly 80% wanting to go to general hospitals or higher. Why? Because they don't have to spend any money. With healthcare coverage and supplemental insurance, patients prefer to go to the perceived best facilities. 

Transportation plays a significant role in this scenario. At the SRT station near the hydrogen station, there are designated areas for buses, taxis, and shuttle buses. These transport options lead directly to Samsung Seoul Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital. This creates a substantial siphoning effect. For instance, if you get off at the express bus terminal, it is right across the street from a major hospital. If you take the KTX at Seoul Station, it’s just a ten-minute walk to Sinchon Severance Hospital, supported by a robust transportation network that acts as a pipeline for rural patients. 

The medical delivery system is supposed to consist of primary, secondary, and tertiary care. However, most patients go to primary healthcare providers only to be referred immediately to tertiary care. As someone who sees patients, I often find myself diagnosing a patient's condition while they are asking for a referral. I usually end up saying, "Sure, I can write you a referral."

Is it really difficult to ask for someone to write something? Everyone is going to upper-level hospitals. The same is true for dermatology; when they see insured patients, I treat both insured and regular patients without distinction, so I have to see about 60 to 70 insured patients a day. That's quite a lot. Those that I see are about 10% to 20% of my total. So, you have to work hard. After referring patients, once word gets out, there’s a culture in our country of queuing up. It's causing the collapse of regional medical services. However, just a couple of days ago, I saw in the JoongAng Ilbo that there are quite a few departments in regional hospitals that are specializing in treating cancer patients or certain diseases and are doing well. There are competitive departments. Ultimately, patients are medical consumers. Since their lives and health depend on it, they don't use regional hospitals just because the government wants them to. They will only use a regional hospital if it is good. It’s not just about increasing the number of doctors to make those hospitals better. If you look at the preceding data, you'll understand that. So, if the government forces an increase beyond a thousand doctors, with some preventive health experts suggesting 2,500 to 4,000, we need to consider what side effects there might be. If the number of doctors increases and their income decreases, that’s not a side effect; that’s not an issue. Just because doctors can’t earn money doesn’t mean there’s a problem; that’s not a social side effect. The real social side effects will emerge as follows: First, if there are more doctors, there will be excessive competition. In fact, there’s already a lot of excessive competition. I will explain this further when I give my detailed explanation later, but this excessive competition leads to unethical over-treatment. This is already happening. Now we are considering increasing the number further? It will just worsen, and the consumers will bear all the consequences. Why? Because the information is biased towards a larger number of doctors. The second point, as I’ve mentioned in my personal YouTube channel, is that currently 3,058 students are receiving education, but if 4,058 students come in next year, will the education be proper? In a general liberal arts setting, if you just expand the lecture hall and add more microphones for the professors, you can accommodate more students. But that's not the case in medical school. When doing cadaver dissections, during our time, six students practiced with one cadaver; now ten students are practicing. So, there’s a situation where thirteen students will need to practice. It becomes necessary to learn by watching over someone’s shoulder. We need additional cadavers, and one likely costs over ten million won. While enlarging lecture halls is relatively simple, the number of teaching faculty will also need to increase, right? Right now, when you enter the operating room, the main operating professor is there with a first-year resident face-to-face, alongside an intern or another first-year helping while observing, and a second-year resident is also present for educational purposes.

Afterward, a tall chair is placed, and students stand on it to observe and learn. If there are three students, that increases by 30%. Currently, in the operating room, if five students are there, it should be six or seven watching. They can't see because there isn't enough space. The surgical field is defined, and it’s not feasible to increase the number exponentially to 1,000; that’s not possible. Despite some doctors having knowledge in preventive medicine, can they truly suggest that the number of students be increased to 2,500 without understanding practical training and medical settings? Even if we were to raise the number, we must do so gradually. Why? Because we need to increase the number of professors, enhance practice facilities, and develop more operating rooms. This should be done step by step; can we realistically expect a 30% increase overnight? Even expanding a car factory takes years—should we think the training of human resources can be done so casually? These are actions performed by people lacking insight. 

My primary concern is point three. Currently, I am open about the fact that nearly 3,000 of the best students are becoming doctors, around 1,000 are becoming dentists, and about 1,000 are becoming traditional medicine practitioners. That's 5,000 people leaving the field. Who will nurture our country? Who will manage Korea's electronics and future industries? In my day, Seoul National University's electronic engineering department was the top choice. No, the physics department ranked highest before electronic engineering. Seoul National University's electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, and medical school were comparable. Medical school was considered prestigious, while electronic engineering was viewed as lower. The elite students would go to physics and electronic engineering, with medical school following. Now, all those departments have fallen behind. If we simply increase the number of doctors in Korea, will our country become wealthy? It's embarrassing for me to even suggest such things.

In my case, I voluntarily chose to become a doctor, making a living, gaining recognition, and becoming a somewhat commercially known doctor. If I oppose the increase of doctors and people accuse me of wanting to live well alone, I’ve made my situation clear, right? I have about five years, at most ten, left in my profession. None of my children are doctors. So, my concern has no personal stake. Today, I was seeing patients when a really bright high school senior, who came for acne treatment, asked me what he should do to succeed. I inquired about his father's occupation.

What does your father do? I asked. The child seemed flustered and responded by questioning what the relationship was between his father and my medical practice. If your father has the ability to support you through a single failure in your livelihood, then pursue what you enjoy, whether it's engineering or computer science. I told him that he could earn significantly more that way. However, if his parents are unable to provide him with the opportunity to overcome a single mistake, then going to medical school isn't a bad idea. I provided that consulting. He mentioned that he found it to be the most appealing advice he had heard and that he would discuss it with his father again. 

Sometimes while seeing patients, I share my thoughts. I genuinely wish that this kid would pursue computer science. There is a sparkle in his eyes when I see potential. But since he is not my child and I can't take responsibility for his future, I had to ask him what he wanted to do. If my child possessed that level of intelligence, I would surely guide them toward computer science. Since my children lack that brilliance, they all studied chemical engineering and bio-sciences, fields where both their parents have backgrounds.

I don't know if I owe any debt to the world by not achieving what I could have through my children. The issue of the concentration of students in medical school and its potential impact on our country’s future industries is something that the ruling officials and lawmakers must consider seriously. Today’s Samsung Electronics has individuals from my peers who went to Seoul National University to study electronic engineering. Those friends, who were more academically accomplished than I, graduated and got jobs at Samsung Electronics. Of course, they made a lot of money. Why? Because as Samsung grew, those with bright minds who worked there naturally became executives, earning substantial stock options, making me feel like I earned a trivial amount compared to them.

However, will we continue to see graduates from Seoul National University in electronic engineering? I’m not so sure. Furthermore, while some believe that increasing the number of doctors will lower their income and healthcare costs, this is a misconception. An increase in the number of doctors invariably raises the healthcare expenses that all citizens bear. Even if doctors' income drops significantly, healthcare costs will still rise. 

To explain, from 1985 to 2015, while South Korea's population increased by 37%, the number of doctors surged by 438%. The growth rate of doctors exceeded the population growth rate by over 11 times, almost 12 times. Even now, despite claims from 2006 that it is fixed, 3,058 doctors graduate every year, while the population continues to decline.

As the population decreases, the working-age individuals capable of producing also declines. We have effectively become an aging nation. Who will bear the medical expenses? In 20 years, today's youth in their 30s and 40s will have to shoulder that burden. In South Korea, the ratio of patients per doctor has sharply decreased since 2000. Currently, there are fewer than 1,000 patients per doctor for those over 50. If we simply increase the number of doctors for this reason, the number of patients per doctor will drop to around 260 by 2035. In simple terms, if a doctor is faced with fewer patients, they might worry about their income and could resort to various unethical practices to make money. 

The notion of upholding the Hippocratic Oath is often disregarded in reality; no one becomes a doctor solely to adhere strictly to it. Generally, people act in their own self-interest. As the population decreases, doctors might engage in unethical medical practices to secure their desired income. 

In a typical market economy, demand creates supply; if someone needs bottled water, a factory is created. However, in healthcare, supply creates demand. Take LASIK surgery as an example: once this technique emerged, it became widely popular. Currently, South Korea has the highest number of Da Vinci robotic surgeries, which are prevalent regardless of the population size. The company producing Da Vinci robots is a venture in San Francisco, with training conducted at the Severance Hospital in Shinchon. 

Supply creates demand, resulting in high costs for treatment. For instance, Da Vinci surgery can cost around 15 million won. Patients often choose to pay out of pocket because they perceive such surgeries to yield better results with less scarring. Additionally, due to insurance limitations, procedures like appendectomies can lead to deficits in healthcare funding, making hospitals reluctant to perform them. Even renowned emergency physicians like Dr. Lee Guk-jong, who are celebrated by the public, face challenges in the hospital due to financial issues tied to emergency services. This is a critical aspect of South Korea's medical system. Consequently, it is callous for anyone to criticize without grasping the underlying issues.

Moreover, South Korea is experiencing rapid aging. The speed of aging in Korea is about four times the OECD average, at 4.066. According to OECD data, men in Korea are projected to reach an average age of 85 by 2030, while women will exceed 90, making South Korea the only country in the world with such a high life expectancy for women. Although these are predictions, if the current trend of increasing life expectancy continues, Korean women will have a life expectancy surpassing 90 by 2030. Celebrating an 80th birthday party is seen as unacceptable; only those who reach 100 are celebrated. This country is unique in the world—Japan does not have the same numbers, only Korea does. Despite having a healthcare system like this, there is a shortage of doctors.

The aging speed in South Korea is rapid, with significant rises in healthcare costs, where elderly care accounts for almost half of the total healthcare expenditure, approximately 44 trillion out of 102 trillion KRW, which is around 40%. However, older adults who own their homes might not feel the burden of medical insurance premiums, leading to costs that need to be shouldered by the younger population. South Korea is among the countries with the fastest growth in per capita healthcare spending, approximately three times the OECD average. This is largely due to the ease of access to healthcare services.

Looking at the demographic data, South Korea is considered a complete aging society, having the highest proportions of the population over 85 and 80 years old in the world. However, in this aging nation, there is a reluctance to have children.

This is an old story—it's about our time. In the past, five young people had to support two elderly individuals, but now two young people have to support five elderly individuals. Moreover, our country's birth rate is dropping rapidly below the OECD average. We are at around 0.7 children per woman, while the OECD average is nearly 2, which is less than half of that. As I mentioned in a personal YouTube discussion, Israel has a very high birth rate. One reason is that women are required to serve in the military, and having a baby exempts them from this service. While this is not the only reason, it is indeed a significant factor. Jewish women tend to have many children. 

The working-age population is sharply declining around 2020, leading to a decrease in birth rates, which results in fewer young people and a rapid increase in the elderly population. By 2060, it is projected that more than 40% of the population will be elderly—aged 65 and over. In a situation where the number of doctors is increasing, leading to rising medical expenses, who is going to pay for this? The burden will fall on the younger generation. By 2050, the ratio will reach 1:1. This is not a distant future; it's a very close reality. In the meantime, the ratio will trend from 1:4 to 1:3, then to 1:2, and eventually to 1:1. Currently, young people are already feeling the strain regarding national pension and health insurance contributions. If fewer children are born and the ratio hits 1:1, who will bear the cost? 

Japan is so concerned about this issue that its Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has already reduced the number of medical school admissions. People might think that raising taxes would solve it, yet when we look at the immediate reality, we mistakenly believe that these issues will resolve themselves. For example, there is much debate about whether Gimpo City should merge with Seoul, and the most contentious issue revolves around the Gold Line. The Gimpo Gold Line is a light rail system with only two cars in operation. The city government made a poor decision back in 2010, opting to construct the light rail without national funding due to higher costs, which led to a complete expenditure of 15 trillion won. Now, it consistently operates at capacity. 

People ask why we can't just extend the service. Extending the subway system is similar to building a new extension, which is not feasible. Residents are upset about connecting to the existing subway line, while the ruling party claims Gimpo has been merged with Seoul, and the opposition party insists that funding for the subway construction should not be subject to budget feasibility studies. Both sides are merely engaging in election campaigns for the metropolitan area. There has been no research on how to allocate funding or alleviate the burden on citizens. They do anything for votes without considering the implications.

Now, I will integrate Gimpo. Without any feasibility study for Line 5, I will unconditionally exempt it from the preliminary budget review and establish Line 5 to connect Gimpo. Such talk comes from those who think they are spending their own money and are concerned about the future. It's the elderly over 60 who make these statements while serving as members of parliament. Their terms of 4, 6, or 8 years will end before they consider how the younger generations in their 20s and 30s will bear the burden. They talk about increasing the number of doctors by 1,000 as if it's an immediate good, but after adding those doctors, they will be forced to be tied to the health insurance system. If the insurance premiums don't increase, those younger doctors, who have increased in number, might feel frustrated and think, "Why should we strike?" However, they will indeed wage intense strikes to demand higher insurance premiums to secure their incomes as doctors. When it comes to that, they will certainly strike. In our time, we didn’t strike because we could make a living without insurance. When people are pushed into a situation where they can't survive, they will disregard everything, including being doctors. Strikes will be intense, leading to an inevitable rise in medical costs. Who will bear these increasing medical expenses? This is Korea's yellow line. The population of those over 80 is changing shape. Japan has long been a high-aged country, ahead of us in this regard. Since 2020, as Korea's elderly population has rapidly increased, it is projected that by 2030, we will catch up with Japan, and by 2050, Korea will have a demographic structure similar to Japan. It is a natural outcome since we have become one of the countries with the longest life expectancy in the world. The question is, who will bear this burden? If we indiscriminately increase the number of doctors, those individuals may give up their medical licenses and choose other professions or be forced into the medical field. All doctors in Korea are subject to mandatory designation. So, won't they fight for higher insurance premiums? Right now, doctors earn without insurance and have some income security, so they aren't very intense about it. But they will be from now on. Then, when medical costs rise, who will pay for it? In 2022, the population aged 65 and over was about 1.5 million, accounting for 15.7%. This is increasing rapidly. This is our expected population structure. Currently, there are still quite a few people in their 30s and 40s. It is expected that as they age, they will develop a deformed structure with thin legs and arms and bellies that stick out.

You have to support these people with the money you earn here. Do you think that is possible? With the rapid increase in elderly care... medical expenses are rising as the elderly population grows, but who is going to pay for it? Retired people have no way to pay. Legally, they are not even required to pay. This creates a structure where two students and two children must support five grandparents. In Japan, about 9,000 medical students graduate every year, and they intend to reduce this number. They plan to cut medical expenses from the total GDP of the nation. Otherwise, they cannot bear the burden.

Actually, our country also spent 8.8% of the total GDP last year on our healthcare system, and it is expected to be about 9.9% in 2023. If healthcare expenses increase as a percentage of GDP, will the people necessarily be happier? Not necessarily. I've discussed this on my personal YouTube channel. In the UK, there is a system called the National Health Service (NHS). Instead of health insurance, they pay a healthcare tax, contributing 15% of their income, which can rise to 18% as their income increases. Everything is free there. They have more physicians than we do, slightly above the OECD average, at about 3.7 per 1,000 people. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, their death rate exceeded 20%. If you look back at what I said on air during the early stages of COVID, it will all come out. They pay more than we do and have far more doctors, yet their death rate is more than 20 times ours. Why does this happen? 

In the UK, all doctors are government employees who work regular hours. Thus, the idea that having a large number of doctors will automatically develop public healthcare and provide excellent benefits for all citizens is a serious misconception. In any society or organization where there is no competition or logic of capital, everyone becomes complacent. I also work until 3 PM on Saturdays. Why do I do that? Because there is demand, and working during that time can yield significantly higher income for me. It’s not about serving; it’s a matter of supply and demand.

Without appropriate incentives for pursuing improvement within such a supply-demand framework, if all doctors are made government employees, it could lead to situations like those in Greece. 

Now, regarding solutions, in order to address the shortage of essential physicians, the reimbursement rates for essential medical care specialties must be dramatically increased.

At least when it comes to the current 4,000 widely available preventive medicine professors, the salary should be increased by about five times. Then they will consider pediatrics, no matter how challenging it is, if that's the salary. If the salary is multiplied by five, there will definitely be no shortage of pediatric residency applicants. It will probably exceed 100%. If it's raised by about three times, it would be almost sufficient. If we aim to gather 100 people, 100 would show up. If we offer an increase of 300,000 won and a monthly salary boost of 1 million won during residency as an incentive for pediatricians, it seems like the people proposing this are incredibly ignorant of the realities of medicine and the medical field, and it feels like desk administration. The payment structure should be normalized. 

Secondly, we need to exempt physicians from criminal liability for events that occur during the course of treatment. If I mistakenly make an error during a medical procedure that is clearly an unintentional mistake, how can I be treated like a criminal? Doctors are not perfect; they can make mistakes during surgeries or treatments. Should they be handcuffed for these errors? Absolutely not; that is extreme. Thus, it is absurd to think that prosecutors or judges, who are confused or misled by the realities of medical practice, can consider their history of imprisoning doctors as a commendable achievement. There are absurd cases where patients are awarded compensation of 1.1 billion won even when the doctor performed the surgery well. The jobs of those patients are indeed interesting and should be investigated. If judges believe that their rulings have significantly advanced healthcare in South Korea after delivering harsh penalties to doctors, they are mistaken. Therefore, doctors should not be criminally charged. 

For departments where medical accidents may occur, the government should significantly operate medical accident relief organizations and take full responsibility for medical incidents. Only then will doctors be willing to perform these tasks. Even doctors themselves might say, "How can someone perform a surgery that way?" There are certainly internal checks within the medical community that can address inadequacies. If we want to manage medical negligence or accidents entirely through insurance, then a proper insurance system must be established. The U.S. has a very well-developed system. About 30% of the income of surgeons or doctors dealing with life-threatening conditions in the U.S. usually goes to insurance premiums. Generally, doctors find themselves in court on Thursday afternoons. Who pays that 30%? The patients do. So, specialists such as cardiologists in the U.S. may have annual incomes of $1.5 million or $2 million, but that includes 30% for insurance premiums.

Addressing the shortage of local doctors has no easy solution. The key lies in making these regions more livable. If an area becomes a good city to live in, the population will grow, and doctors will flock there even if they are told not to. If we want to resolve the shortage of regional doctors, fundamentally, we need to consider restructuring administrative systems in our country. The current complex division of administrative regions—such as special cities, metropolitan cities, local autonomous cities, and provinces—hinders the survival of rural areas. If local communities cannot thrive and residents move to the capital area, then doctors will also congregate there. There is a joke that when we reach the stage of opening our practices, we ask our seniors where it is good to go.

So, if a region has a population of a few thousand people, they need to have a clinic; where should they look for an apartment? However, there are still no doctors in that area. I replied with a smile, saying that Dokdo doesn’t have a single doctor. If a doctor opens a clinic there, will it succeed? That is the logic of the market. Therefore, while the population in rural areas is declining, they say we need to increase the number of doctors. Politicians, who make such contradictory statements, should reconsider their sanity and sense of balance. If the population in their electoral district is decreasing, can they really insist on increasing the number of doctors? Isn’t that unreasonable?

To revitalize rural areas, bold measures like administrative district reform are necessary. If they want to address the issue of local doctors, the medical delivery system should be handled rigorously. However, this will burden local residents with resistance. For example, if I lived in Changwon and were diagnosed with stomach cancer, would I choose to undergo surgery at Chungnam National University Hospital or go to my alma mater, Severance Hospital in Sinchon? I'd likely prefer Severance Hospital. It’s possible to create a system within the medical delivery framework that says, "Since you live in Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do, you cannot go to Seoul." But implementing this would be meaningless and ineffective.

If rural areas improve and become more livable, doctors will benefit as well. Thus, in the process of increasing the number of doctors, there is ongoing talk about implementing a regional allocation system. Even if such a system were introduced, for example, if 100 medical students were selected from a national university, and 20 were chosen through regional allocation, what happens to those 20? If the law requires them to practice and work in that area, wouldn’t it conflict with constitutional rights? This creates a scenario where the freedom of residence and choice of profession are significantly restricted, leading to many potential constitutional lawsuits. 

The likelihood of the Constitutional Court ruling the law that requires regional allocation and binding those chosen to practice in specific locales as unconstitutional is high. The idea of implementing a simple legal framework that mandates these students practice in their designated area for ten years is problematic. Imagine a student studying to join medical school: What kind of academic ability would someone, chosen under a special allocation system, possess? If they were competent, they would naturally compete for a chance to be in the larger pool of 80 students. What about the skills of students applying under the regional allocation system? While one could argue that a doctor doesn’t necessarily have to be exceptionally smart, as patients, would you want to be treated by a doctor who came in through a regional allocation system or one who entered through standard competitive means? How do you feel about this? Your sentiments mirror the aspirations of both patients and doctors. 

Let me provide an example from Greece.

In 2007, there were 5.3 doctors per 1,000 people. This situation is similar to ours, where doctors tend to focus on specific specialties without working in rural areas, a trend that is observed worldwide. By 2019, the number of doctors increased to 6.3 per 1,000 people. However, this led to a mass exodus of doctors abroad. A total of 17,500 doctors moved to various EU countries. Consequently, there is also a lack of doctors in the public sector and intensive care units. 

Although the market is diverse, allowing patients to shape the healthcare landscape, doctors are mainly involved in the supply side. If the number of doctors increases, those capable will seek opportunities abroad; for instance, they might move from countries like Korea to the US. 

Data on the mobility of doctors within the EU shows a significant outflow, with Romania and Greece being the top countries from which doctors emigrate, while the UK is the most popular destination for incoming doctors. The UK's NHS system offers attractive salaries compared to those in Romania and Greece, alongside a favorable work-life balance with strict adherence to working hours. 

As a result, the UK does not suffer from a shortage of doctors; however, native doctors often move to the US, where obtaining a medical license can be relatively straightforward after a simple interview. This creates a situation where countries with less favorable conditions for doctors attract incoming physicians.

In conclusion, rather than implementing popular policies aimed at increasing the number of doctors indefinitely, I believe it would be more beneficial for the country to find a balance in maintaining the number of doctors to sustain the current level of healthcare within the GDP 10% range over the next ten years. I would like to engage directly with you to discuss the healthcare system and the implications of doctor shortages.

Hmm... the allocation system is not as easy as it seems. Legally, it's quite complicated. From my perspective, even if we have 3,058 new doctors each year, the rate of increase suggests that there is no chance of a doctor shortage. I want to clarify my position: I am not speaking as a doctor but as someone who has worked in healthcare and is concerned about the country's future. You can trust my sincerity, as there is no personal stake in whether the number of doctors increases or not. As I mentioned earlier, I will no longer be in practice within the next 5 to 10 years, and I have no relatives or children who are doctors. Therefore, I am not an interested party.

However, having been active in the healthcare sector since 1986, I have a deep understanding of its realities and want to urge the public to carefully consider this issue. Do not just listen to what some progressive media, certain politicians, or the government are saying. I've referenced data from the OECD. We should not only focus on the numbers, such as the 3.6 and 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people that we often cite. I've provided a comprehensive explanation of all the underlying data.

After considering this, if you believe that increasing the number of doctors by 1,000 is beneficial for our future generations, then you can support those advocating for that stance. Conversely, if after my explanation you think that increasing the number of doctors could lead to excessive healthcare spending, making it difficult for the country to develop normally, then you may support parties that advocate for stabilizing the number of doctors or even reducing it slightly while utilizing fewer, specialized doctors to curb unnecessary healthcare costs, which can exceed certain GDP thresholds.

Currently, it seems that all politicians are in favor of increasing the number of doctors, leaving the public with little choice. The politicians arguing for an increase are interested parties. Medical students and current interns or residents might also have vested interests. I, however, do not belong to that group. Therefore, you can trust my perspective.

Politicians are in a position where they trade votes, and media outlets often have their own interests. Medical students or residents may feel that an increase in doctors poses competition for them, making them stakeholders as well. However, when doctors over the age of 60 speak on this matter, it cannot be considered from a self-interested standpoint. My comments are based on the hope that our country will thrive and develop, even with a decreasing population.

If you believe that doctors earn too much and agree that we should increase their numbers, then that is valid. An increase in the number of doctors will likely reduce individual earnings, and doctors cannot take on three or four times the workload compared to those in other countries. However, the cost incurred will have to be borne entirely by you and your children—this is a scenario I encourage you to think about carefully.

Interestingly, when the previous government proposed increasing medical student enrollments by 300, the Korean Medical Association strongly opposed it. Now, with plans to increase by 1,000, the association remains silent. There have been many troubling discussions, including allegations that the current president of the association supported this increase, leading to impeachment discussions regarding him. Furthermore, a professor advocating for increasing the number of doctors to 2,500 or 4,500 faced disciplinary actions from the association, highlighting ongoing conflicts. The current leadership's clear stance on increasing the number of doctors by 1,000 is something I regard as an expression of their own interests.

When you look at who will be running in next year's general elections, you can predict certain outcomes. However, this isn't something that should be discussed on the political stage. Even if we consider the current OECD data, we need to look at the entire OECD data set. I’ve already shown you the OECD data; I haven't included any statistics from Korea or those generated by the medical association. To claim that there is a shortage of doctors while the number is increasing rapidly, at a rate nearly 2.6 times higher than the OECD average, is misleading. Even if we assume there is a shortage today, it's not true when looking at the results of medical care. Moreover, suggesting an increase in doctors by 1,000, 2,500, or 4,500 each year—when we currently have 3,000—raises the question of who would teach these new doctors. It sounds like something said by people without any real understanding.

Reflecting back on statements I made during the COVID-19 crisis, where I argued against forcibly vaccinating young students under 18, I believe that those comments were based on ethical considerations, rather than personal interests or those of my peers. At that time, I provided data that was completely truthful. The data I am showing you today is also truthful, and if people still fail to understand and instead allow emotions to dictate their support for simply hiring more doctors—suggesting that it’s fine to double the number of doctors because they are well off—then there isn’t much one can say about it. 

Indeed, hiring more doctors may reduce individual incomes. However, the financial burden that results from increased healthcare costs must be shared among all citizens. In particular, we should consider how, over time, today’s teenagers and twenties will be affected by this burden on healthcare and how it might impact the economy in the future.

Let’s use a simpler analogy: imagine a household of four generations living together—grandfather, father, yourself, and your grandchild. If we assume the household has an income of 10 million won a month, how much can you spend on the grandfather’s healthcare? You must balance your financial responsibilities for your family's growth and future. For example, if you earn 10 million won per month, you might not be willing to spend more than 1 million won on your mother's healthcare, which might disappoint her, but continuing to spend 3 to 4 million won on her would be unsustainable. Unlike a family that ends when parents pass on, a nation accumulates elderly citizens continuously. Therefore, it's important to reflect on this situation on a personal level. If you have this income, how much would you allocate for treatment? 

It’s one matter to spend on the treatment of someone who can still contribute to the family, like a healthy child, but constantly spending large amounts on elderly care could lead to significant issues for the family structure. While I might come off as harsh, it’s necessary to view this matter objectively. This is why politicians continue to talk about increasing medical school admissions and senior welfare, as those voters hold significant power.

The statement discusses the current situation regarding medical professionals in South Korea, particularly the shortage of physicians compared to OECD averages. The speaker expresses disbelief that this is a problem for older doctors, like themselves, who have decades of experience. They encourage viewers to examine various data points instead of being misled by a simple assertion about the number of doctors. The speaker reflects on their personal journey, highlighting how their education and opportunities, like a chance to train in the U.S., contributed to their success in dermatology, while recognizing that this may not represent the typical physician’s experience. They mention specific health concerns for a 250-day-old baby with atopic dermatitis and suggest the best clinic for treatment, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive healthcare system involving multiple specialties. 

The speaker also addresses misconceptions about the relationship between the number of doctors and the financial burden on citizens. They illustrate with an example how increasing the number of doctors does not necessarily mean a direct financial decrease for each physician. Further, personal struggles in balancing finances, like caregiving costs, are discussed, acknowledging that while they might be temporary, issues faced by the state are more persistent and complex. 

Lastly, they comment on the career choices of new medical graduates and the trend of aspiring doctors favoring high-demand specialties, suggesting that practical choices may lead more students to seek alternative paths in their training, often resulting in a large percentage of dermatologists being non-specialists.

Nail fungus is not hereditary. It is caused by a fungal infection. Using medication can resolve the issue, with both topical and oral options available. Without medical insurance, doctors act according to market logic, which limits their capacity to help. Dermatologists should focus on consultations rather than engaging in political discussions. Why shouldn't dermatologists discuss politics? I am also a taxpayer and a citizen of South Korea. If you are struggling with issues related to the 50 billion won, I've worked together with you on broadcasts several times. Dr. Park Seong-jin has a practice nearby; you should consider visiting him. If you don't want to hear the discussion, you are free to leave. This broadcast is for those who want to watch and engage in debates, not a place for insults. I've never asked anyone to join; in a democratic society, politics influences everything. If politics is not sound, nothing works. In the past, during authoritarian times, politics was unnecessary, as competent administrators could enforce their will without dissent. However, that's not the case now; the citizens need to reach a consensus, and that process is democracy. It takes time, so the public must be informed and aware of data. If individuals are swayed by propaganda, it can mislead the country's direction. A close example is the Gimpo Gold Line; 1.5 trillion won has been invested, yet it operates like a hellish subway, unable to expand. This situation arose from democratic elections and decisions made during the 8-year tenure of a mayor. Therefore, just because someone is whispering sweet promises does not guarantee a secure future. The presidential term is 5 years with a single term limit, and mayors can serve for 4 years, up to three times. Members of the National Assembly serve 4 years and can be re-elected multiple times. These politicians are discussing issues based on their own short-term tenures of 4 or 5 years.

The country needs to discuss matters spanning 50 or 100 years. That’s the essence of the conversation. Adjusting the number of doctors and medical fees thoroughly is essential in medical economics. This is a conversation that needs to be led by economists. However, economists don't typically engage in this discussion, even though there are many who are interested. I had a chance to broadcast with Dr. Lee Sung-koo about medical economics. Therefore, the task for the state is to find the balance between doctors' expected profits, patients' expected benefits, and the national cost burden as well as the overall healthcare expenses, looking at it from both a micro and macro perspective. There's a specific field of economics dedicated to this. Economists should be given opportunities to voice their opinions, but often decisions are made in a centralized manner, leading to problems.

In comparison to other countries, healthcare costs in our country are about one-tenth of those in the United States. For instance, my daughter gave birth to my grandchild in San Francisco and was hospitalized for about three to four days. The total cost, including hospitalization and delivery, amounted to $132,000. When calculated, that’s approximately 150 million won. Initially, I thought it would just be about 15 million won. As I mentioned earlier, the government reports that around 70% to 80% of these costs are covered. The remaining portion is left for individuals to manage without insurance. This is where uninsured patients rely on certain doctors.

There are cases where shingles can present without a skin rash because pain can occur before any rash develops. For example, if one experiences pain in the right side, it may be misdiagnosed as gallbladder issues, while pain in the left side could be diagnosed as kidney stones. Misdiagnosis continues until a clear red rash appears, which is when dermatologists can provide proper treatment, often resolving the issue within a week with medication rather than surgery.

My daughter didn’t personally pay the 150 million won; she had been contributing about 15% to 20% of her annual salary towards health insurance during her seven years of employment and had never visited a hospital during that entire period. This led to her getting all of those benefits at once when needed, resulting in her only having to pay a few thousand dollars out of pocket. The United States is known for its abundance of doctors, but it also faces extremely high medical costs. This is partly because medical licenses in the U.S. are granted by the president of the American Medical Association, which leads to minimal governmental involvement. The U.S. operates on a consensus basis among individuals, which strengthens the influence of medical associations and allows for a favorable environment for medical fees.

There are many instances where dermatologists cannot distinguish between moles and skin cancer. Often, there are ambiguous cases. Therefore, it is generally standard practice to perform a biopsy if there are changes in moles after the age of 60. Many times, visual identification of moles can be difficult and often goes unconsidered. However, if a person over 60 has a mole on their face that appears slightly unusual, it is prudent to suspect skin cancer and to have a biopsy performed at a university hospital. 

Using Melanon cream can help with melasma. Some precautions should be followed: first, do not apply a large amount at once; rather, should control the quantity and use the minimal amount necessary. Additionally, due to potential irritation, it is advisable to apply the cream over a foundation. It should only be applied at night, and it should not be used during pregnancy. 

Regarding educational institutions, do not expect testimonies that claim to move medical students without a factual basis; these are unlikely to be verifiable claims. Is taking a lot of Vitamin C effective in clearing the skin? Personally, I have not conducted such clinical studies and remain skeptical despite some claims. Simply raising numbers is the bare minimum solution; it's not just about percentages such as 10%, 20%, or 30%.

The Chosun Ilbo has a critical stance on medical school quotas but seems to support them overall. This support appears to be commercially motivated, encouraging more clicks and views. Many people discussing conservatism inherently focus on the country's future more than individual interests. Medical school quotas may not lead to the country's downfall, but I believe they contribute to an unsafe trajectory for the nation.

South Korea's healthcare system is among the best in the world, potentially even the best in our galaxy. Compared to other systems, especially in neighboring galaxies like Andromeda, South Korea's system is unparalleled. The current issues lie in regional healthcare and the reluctance of doctors to engage in essential medical sectors. This needs to be addressed through appropriate healthcare financing for those working in essential medicine, as that is the only viable solution. Alternatively, opening up non-insured sectors could allow for reasonable income generation, thereby enabling a necessary sacrifice in the insured sector.

In my case, if I see about 100 patients a day, I treat 60 or 70 insurance patients and 30 or 40 non-insurance patients. I don't distinguish between insurance and non-insurance patients; I simply see them in the order they register. Let me share a true story. I opened my clinic in Daechi-dong over ten years ago, and shortly after, I received a phone call from the health center. They introduced themselves and then requested that I treat more insurance patients. I asked if clinics differentiate between insurance and non-insurance patients, and they said that in dermatology, there are often cases where clinics do not see insurance patients, leading to many complaints. I questioned whether that was appropriate for a doctor, indicating that such behavior is more fitting for a beauty consultant. They told me that it was indeed a problem. 

So, I began to see patients, and interestingly, many insurance patients from Gangnam came to me. I asked them why they traveled so far, even from Bundang sometimes. They replied that it took too long to get an appointment elsewhere. I couldn’t understand why it took so long in a country with so many clinics. When they called other dermatology clinics, they would be told, "We can schedule you for an appointment in six months because we are very busy." This situation arises from the excessive competition in dermatology. As the number of doctors increases, this type of issue occurs more frequently. I was unaware of who these doctors were, but I learned from my patients that this is how insurance patients are being neglected. I realized this for the first time ten years ago. Even back then, if too many insurance patients visit a clinic, there wouldn’t be enough time to see non-insurance patients. Given my working hours of eight or nine hours, if insurance patients occupy my time, I would be unable to treat the more profitable non-insurance patients.

So, while providing consultations in a reservation system, they tend to draw in patients like this. What's the reason for this? It's because the reimbursement rates for insurance patients are too low. However, there are many dermatologists like me. Either with or without insurance, there are many doctors who will see all patients when they come in. Why? Because there's also about 30-40% of non-insured patients. There are acne patients, those who want to remove melasma, and those who want to have moles removed - that’s where my income comes from, not from seeing 60 or 70 insurance patients. If I invest 70-80% of my time in patients from that category, I will not make money. How do I earn money? I earn it from those non-insured services. Only those specializations that have this area are popular, and people flock to those specialties. Therefore, it’s natural for the reimbursement rates for specialties that only see insurance patients to be increased. If we don't do that, it's unrealistic to force that specialty to operate within those conditions. Some doctors and media suggest that merely hiring more physicians will create a "Naxos effect," but that’s incorrect. No matter how many we hire, the Naxos effect won't happen because the profit gained from non-insured treatments is much greater. 

Currently, MZ generation doctors don’t even specialize but work generally. For instance, if a younger doctor, say a friend of my son, comes and asks if they can learn here for a year, would I tell them not to come? If someone graduates from medical school and comes asking to learn, would I really say no? Of course, I would invite them in. So, if this person comes for a year but isn’t a dermatology specialist, should I refuse to teach? No, of course, I would teach them; they are the child of a friend. This will lead to an increase in such doctors. There are also regulations preventing them from practicing clinical medicine unless they've been in the field for two years. After two years, they will specialize. 

Can one create a system while stripping the individual doctors of their profit motives? That notion is delusional. It will never be realized. Therefore, the government and authorities must engage in more open discussions with the medical association regarding the current healthcare system, medical costs, and reimbursement issues. Especially the specialty doctors involved in essential medical practices and their leadership roles must be open to dialogue. It’s not productive to dismiss them by saying, "You are already rich, so why complain?" Some surgeons are well-off, but it’s mostly a select few, particularly those specialized in fields like thyroid surgery.

Next, there are surgical specialists who focus solely on breast surgery, and others who specialize in anal diseases. Some hospitals in these specialized fields have found commercial success. However, the vast majority of surgeons cannot achieve the same level of success. The question is whether they can continue to survive in this way. Until now, they have been getting by. Junior doctors observing this undoubtedly do not wish to pursue those specialties. Regardless of how many doctors are trained, they will not choose those paths. While many can become doctors, not all can thrive in such fields. If the simplistic mindset of producing more doctors to address these issues is not re-evaluated, we will eventually face significant pressure on the entire national healthcare system, in a not-so-distant future, within 10 to 20 years. This concludes today's broadcast. Thank you for listening to this uninteresting and tedious discussion. Thank you for your efforts.
