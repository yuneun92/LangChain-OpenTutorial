Increasing the medical school enrollment by 2,000 is a minimum essential measure to fulfill the constitutional responsibilities of the country. Considering the rising demand for healthcare due to an aging population, increased medical demand resulting from rising income, and the trend of reduced working hours for doctors, it is evident that more physicians are needed. Recent statistics indicate that the working hours of doctors have decreased by an average of 12%, while those of resident doctors have reduced by an average of 16%. Additionally, the aging of physicians is a severe concern, with the percentage of doctors aged 70 and above projected to rise from 6.8% in 2022 to 19.8% by 2035. The physician-to-population ratio in the U.S. averages 3.7 per 1,000 people, whereas South Korea has only 2.1. When converted into numbers, this means roughly 80,000 more doctors are needed based on the current demographics in South Korea.

It is difficult to accept opposition to the testimony against these facts based solely on the vested interests of specific medical groups without any scientific basis. Threatening public health and life through collective actions is hard to justify under any pretext. The government has begun procedures to suspend the licenses of those resident doctors who have not returned to the healthcare field. As the government and the medical community confront each other, chaos in the healthcare environment is intensifying. Professor Chung-sun Jeong, from Yonsei University’s Medical Administration department, who supports the increase in medical school enrollment, will discuss the current situation and solutions.

When asked about the suspension of licenses, Professor Jeong suggested that the government is using both incentive and punitive measures to bring back resident doctors who have been absent from the field. However, despite these efforts, the return of these doctors remains stagnant. He elaborated that while resident doctors are young and typically earn lower wages, they are overworked. They may feel a sense of uncertainty about their future due to the announcement of the increase in medical school enrollment, which may lead to increased competition in securing jobs. The ongoing situation stems from a long-standing issue of increasing medical school enrollment that needs resolution.

The discussion also touched on the polarizing topic of whether there are adequate incentives in place to encourage doctors to work in essential medical fields. It was noted that while the government has tried to address these concerns over a long time, the medical community’s stance has not shifted significantly, leading to a stagnant policy dialogue. The editor emphasized adapting current policies surrounding essential care remuneration if the government wants more physicians to specialize in those fields.

Professor Jeong indicated that increasing the medical school enrollment is critical. He cautioned that if concessions are made now, future negotiations may not yield any productive outcomes.

Thank you, professor, for the long conversation over the phone today. Yes, take care. Thank you. This has been Professor Jeong Hyeong-seon. Now, let’s delve into the contentious issues at hand. Our guest today is Professor Kim Yoon from the Department of Medical Management at Seoul National University. Welcome. Good to see you, Professor. You mentioned you're in the Department of Medical Management? Yes, that’s right. It’s a relatively unfamiliar field, but the Department teaches about healthcare policy and hospital management within a medical school. So, you’re the most accurate guest for today, right? Yes, indeed. I assume you’ve done a lot of research on how medical professionals should be trained. However, doctors seem to dislike it. Do doctors dislike it? What about you, Professor? 

Are you a doctor as well? Yes, I graduated from medical school, completed my internship, and then opted to specialize in medical management instead of pursuing a clinical residency. Sounds good. What did your peers say at that time? Did they question your choice? Yes, some expressed that concern, while others wished me well in my journey. 

First, let’s get to the core question. Should we increase the medical school enrollment? Absolutely, we need to expand the enrollment. Is there a specific number in mind? According to OECD standards, to reach the average medical school enrollment in countries like ours, we need to increase our current enrollment by 2,500 students. To just meet the average, 2,500 more is necessary. If we want to avoid widening the gap with OECD countries, we need to align our numbers with theirs as well, which is already relatively low. Therefore, we need to increase the medical school enrollment by 2,500.

Currently, what is the total enrollment? It stands at 3,058 students. So, the annual enrollment is fixed? Yes, it is. There is a gap of about 60,000 doctors between OECD countries and our country. If we aim to fill that gap by increasing by 1,000 per year, it will take 60 years to reach the OECD average. This means if we increase by 3,500, we would reach that average in 60 years. If we increase by 4,500, we could reach it in 30 years, and a 5,500 increase would mean 20 years. This is based on recent evaluations. Major European countries and the US are also rapidly increasing their medical school enrollments. 

Did they also increase their numbers? Yes, they are increasing; some countries are nearly doubling their medical schools. For instance, Germany has decided to add 5,000 more medical school seats this year. And they originally had 17,000 seats to begin with. Why such a sudden increase? Due to population aging and the shortage of physicians highlighted by the COVID pandemic. The UK has also decided to double its medical school enrollment, and Japan aims to increase the number of doctors by nearly 1,800 by 2019. France has removed the cap on medical school enrollments, allowing universities to autonomously determine their output of medical professionals.

You mentioned 1,000 enrollments earlier. Can we realistically do this? How can we increase our enrollment by 1,000? Physicians argue that increasing the number of medical students might produce underqualified doctors, potentially destabilizing the healthcare system. Currently, the top 1% in terms of academic performance get into medical school, and only 3,058 slots are available; the rest go to computer engineering, for example. If only 2% or 3% of the students are admitted, there would be a significant difference in qualifications among candidates. The issue is not merely the admissions process but also how these students will be educated. 

Let’s take Seoul National University as an example. It has about 2,300 professors overall, but how many are there in the medical school? There are around 550 professors in the medical college. That’s quite different from the total number of professors. The student-to-faculty ratio in the medical college is very favorable due to the large number of clinical professors involved in patient care at affiliated hospitals. Many medical professors do not even teach more than a few hours a year. Some of my friends who are medical professors don’t teach at all; they primarily focus on clinical practice. 

Yes, medical school professors have a unique situation since they balance teaching with clinical duties. As such, the teaching capacity is generally adequate, although there could be a need for more foundational professors in subjects like anatomy and biochemistry if student numbers rise. There have been recent issues affecting the education of residents, especially regarding medical imaging, where professors have noted a shortage of doctors in that field and decided to return the residency positions offered to them. This has been exacerbated by new healthcare policies, work shortages that arose during COVID, and an imbalance in doctor salaries that has seen salaries skyrocket over recent years.

Over time, as the number of medical students increases, the issue of limited residency positions can be managed, especially since the adjustments will only take effect in a distant future. As the public debate continues, many believe an increase should happen, yet major medical organizations resist due to concerns over preserving professional salaries. For instance, while the average worker's salary has risen minimally, physicians' income has surged significantly. 

Regarding starting salaries, after completing medical licensure and residency, base salaries for new doctors vary, ranging from 300 million to 400 million won per year now, considerably higher than the average laborer’s salary of around 45 million won annually, nearly tenfold. Even when comparing this to the OECD average, where a physician's income is typically three to five times that of the average worker, ours is disproportionately high. 

The doctors express concern that simply increasing admissions won't solve the underlying problems with healthcare specialties that are less appealing, such as pediatrics or thoracic surgery. Thus, I often clarify that simply increasing medical school admissions is a necessary but not sufficient condition for addressing the healthcare challenges we face. Effective healthcare policies and system supports will ensure that newly admitted physicians can equitably serve necessary healthcare roles, especially in underserved areas. The recent government initiatives for regional medical schools seek to create a sustainable healthcare system capable of addressing emergency and critical patient needs locally.

Public perception often suggests that there’s an oversupply of doctors in hospitals due to the sheer volume of patients they need to see. This disparity can be improved with both an increase in doctors and adjustments to consultation fees, allowing for longer appointments and better care.

Certainly. For example, it's commonly said that if you don't treat a cold, it lasts for a week, and if you do treat it, it also lasts about a week. When someone has cold symptoms, like a runny nose and cough, they might take medicine to relieve the discomfort, which is comforting. However, is there a need for these cold patients to come back every two or three days? This occurs in a low-income environment with high competition as the demand for income exists, resulting in patients being asked to return frequently. In a university hospital, a hypertension patient may only need to visit once every six months or even once a year, while a local clinic might require visits once a month. The frequency of visits is indeed overwhelming. 

Typically, a doctor's consultation lasts about 15 minutes in other countries, but it seems to be only 3 to 5 minutes in Korea, often not exceeding 5 minutes. The medical association argues that despite a shortage of doctors in Korea, they manage to see more patients compared to their foreign counterparts, but the short and frequent consultation times ultimately equate to seeing about one-third the number of patients compared to abroad. This means the absolute number of doctors is indeed insufficient.

If the number of doctors increases, the expectation is that their income will adjust accordingly. However, unnecessary consultations may actually increase, leading to an overall rise in national medical expenditures. This creates two effects: when there is a shortage of doctors, wages (or doctor income) may rise, while increasing the number of doctors could lead to unnecessary treatments. Presently, there is a shortage of doctors, causing wages to spike while patients cannot receive the necessary services they need.

In university hospitals, there is a lack of doctors resulting in essential services being unavailable. Meanwhile, local clinics often provide excessive non-essential treatments. The problem can’t merely be solved by increasing the supply of doctors; it needs to be addressed through medical policies that simultaneously enhance necessary healthcare services and reduce unnecessary over-treatment.

When emergency patients arrive at comprehensive hospitals, it has been noted that doctors may not be available to help, resulting in patients being turned away. For instance, among the large university hospitals across the country, only about 20% can treat pediatric emergency cases around the clock. Therefore, in situations where families seek care for pediatric emergencies, options for where to go are extremely limited.

Some argue against increasing the number of doctors in light of the declining population, suggesting that by the time new doctors complete their training in about ten years, the population could have decreased even further. A specific statistic indicates that by 2035, 1 million will have decreased in population, while there will be an increase of 7 million elderly people. The effect of the growing elderly population on medical expenditure and demand for care outstrips that of the overall population decline by a factor of five.

The logic here raises concerns about whether current advanced countries are misguided in their healthcare policies promoting an increase in healthcare providers. Although efforts to improve the distribution and quality of healthcare in rural areas are needed, existing healthcare education and employment strategies often fail to consider the local healthcare ecosystem, which could lead to ongoing shortages in essential services and unnecessary excess in non-essential treatments.

For instance, the Gangneung Asan Hospital in a region with a population of only 300,000 has a higher standard of care than the national average, demonstrating that the quality of a hospital can attract skilled doctors, regardless of location. Therefore, while proximity to metropolitan areas can influence where residents choose to live and work, the quality of the healthcare institution is often a more critical factor for physicians' employment decisions.

The government currently proposes expanding medical school enrollment, especially in rural universities, but between half of the medical students in rural areas are from the metropolitan region, leading to a concentrated flow of healthcare professionals towards urban centers.

The discussion today, with insights from Professor Kim In of Seoul National University and the Department of Medical Management, illustrates that while the increase in medical school enrollment is supported by many, it also raises contentious debate, particularly among current physicians who have differing opinions on the issue. The government must balance these perspectives thoughtfully to establish effective health policies. 

In light of this, the Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, Park Min-soo, addresses the serious situation regarding a high number of resignations among medical residents, with over 70% having left their positions. The government is currently working to encourage these individuals to return rather than facing legal repercussions for dereliction of duty. The conversations surrounding these issues are complex and demonstrate the intricate relationship between healthcare supply, demand, and the underlying policies meant to support them.

I will explain later about the various imbalances in our healthcare system, which ultimately suggest that alternatives exist, according to certain individuals. However, the government does not seem open to changes or negotiations regarding the increase in the number of medical students, which is a major point of contention. We believe that if we don't address the healthcare system now, the problems will only worsen in the future. There are various measures prepared, including increasing the number of medical students, but we must act on these now to alleviate the issues over the next five to ten years, allowing citizens to receive timely medical treatment.

The issues with the healthcare system are well-known through various reports, such as finding no doctors in emergency rooms or people traveling to major hospitals in Seoul from rural areas. We cannot solely blame the patients for these problems. There are severe physician shortages in local hospitals, particularly affecting departments like pediatrics and internal medicine, where support is lacking.

From the perspective of medical providers, there are also significant issues. One of the most severe problems is burnout among hospital staff. This has led to a vicious cycle where fewer medical residents are applying for roles, exacerbating the difficulties. Departments like pediatrics, cardiology, and thoracic surgery have been recognized for their tough working conditions, long hours, and not necessarily high financial rewards, resulting in fewer residents pursuing these specialties.

Hospitals in larger cities like Seoul may not appear to be as impacted, but regional hospitals, especially at the university level, face collapsing systems, leading some to openly declare that they are already in a state of failure. The staffing crisis in emergency rooms means patients may not receive treatment in a timely manner, leading to potentially tragic outcomes.

While hospitals in Seoul also face challenges, their scale and higher personnel numbers provide some level of support. In contrast, smaller regional hospitals with fewer staff members face situations where older professors may be on call multiple times a week, which is unsustainable. This leads to a lifework imbalance that further discourages new entrants into the medical field.

There are urgent concerns regarding recruiting medical staff in specialty areas. For example, the residency acceptance rate for obstetrics and gynecology is only around 68%, with very few choosing to specialize in obstetrics, which entails treating expectant mothers. This leads to difficulties as hospitals look after critical cases like infertility that require substantial after-hours commitments.

Moreover, there is a misconception that all physicians in local work settings are highly compensated. In reality, many university hospital professors earn salaries that may be among the lowest in the medical professional group. This disparity may hinder the motivation of medical graduates who genuinely wish to serve their communities.

The current compensation structures do not provide enough of an incentive for hospitals to hire more doctors. The overall payment structure forces hospitals to reconsider their staffing solutions, especially when they face financial limitations. Hence, the input of government intervention is critical to balance the financial state of local medical institutions, enabling them to recruit more professionals and improve conditions.

There is an imbalance in our healthcare model, which categorically differentiates between hospitals and private practices, with the former facing higher risks and lower compensation. This leads to a moral dilemma regarding equitable compensation within healthcare roles.

Additionally, significant shifts have occurred in the cosmetic surgery market over the years. Unlike in the past, today’s primary clientele includes an older demographic seeking services not covered by insurance, leading to lucrative incomes in the cosmetic sector, thereby exacerbating the financial struggles of traditional hospital medicine.

The income gap between private practice and hospital roles continues to widen, noticeably affecting how new medical graduates perceive their career pathways. The risk of returning to the, often low-paying hospital positions discourages medical professionals from staying. The societal changes regarding working hours and workload also contribute further to this dissatisfaction within the medical community.

This systemic imbalance has created an environment where many health professionals feel compelled to seek better financial opportunities outside the traditional healthcare institutions.

On January 1st, when my mother hands me 30 pieces of underwear, I receive them and use them over 30 days, after which I meet with my mother at the end of the month to give her back the laundry and receive new underwear. This reflects the lives of past interns, many of whom have now become professors, but this approach does not resonate with today's youth. Moreover, the law has been amended to limit working hours to a maximum of 89 hours, which can’t exceed that. This trend is likely to continue to strengthen in the future.

The government needs to address the imbalance in the current workforce of 3,058 interns as the population ages and healthcare demand surges. To handle this increased demand, expanding the workforce is inevitable, accompanied by necessary structural reforms. The idea is to increase the number of interns by about 2,000. However, there are skeptics who argue about the feasibility of increasing the number of interns by such a significant margin, given the current workforce is already at 3,000 and a jump of 70% seems implausible.

Historically, the current number, 3,058, was established in 2006 after a reduction from approximately 3,500 as a result of negotiations related to separate billing practices in medicine. The medical community accepted a reduction to relieve financial pressures. Since then, there have been continuous studies indicating a shortage of doctors, compounded by attempts to increase the number of interns being continually frustrated.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government proposed to increase the numbers by 400 annually for ten years. This calculation was based on restoring the numbers cut during the separate billing crisis and addressing the demand for medical scientists. However, this proposal faced resistance from interns who protested for several weeks, exacerbating workforce shortages in hospitals already strained by the pandemic.

While it is acknowledged that there's a shortage of doctors, especially in essential specialties and emergency services, the larger urban hospitals often have adequate access to physicians. It is not simply a matter of increasing numbers without addressing the underlying factors, including the poor conditions and inadequate compensation that deter new doctors from entering certain specialties.

Essential specializations need attention and restructuring to balance the supply and demand across the healthcare system. If solutions are only sought through increasing numbers without addressing systemic issues, healthcare costs could skyrocket, burdening the public. Decisions should be made with consideration for the public good, avoiding a self-serving increase in the number of medical students without comprehensive planning.

In addressing specialty training, it is important not only to increase numbers but also to reform training systems. The current internship system, which lasts a year, has been criticized for not adequately preparing interns for real clinical practice. Reforming this system to mix administrative training with practical clinical experience could improve efficiency and job satisfaction for future doctors.

Discussions around changing the structure of medical training should not be treated as static rules but should involve comprehensive dialogue among medical professionals and government bodies to align on solutions that enhance both the quality of care and the working conditions of medical practitioners.

To address these issues while gaining practical clinical experience, we should enhance the training system. Recently, there has been a significant problem where only about 20% of medical graduates choose to pursue residency programs, compared to nearly 95% in the past. Many of these graduates immediately open their own clinics. There are rumors suggesting that their income might be better than that of those in specialty training, but their clinical experience is lacking. This raises concerns about whether they can manage effectively without sufficient clinical experience after just six years of medical school. Thus, the initiative is to strengthen the training system rather than simply extending the duration of internships, which has often been misunderstood. 

The aim is to establish a licensing system for those wishing to open clinics immediately after graduating from medical school, similar to what Japan is doing. However, implementing this system in Korea requires additional discussion within our healthcare reform committee. 

Now, regarding the number of 2,000 new medical students, it seems substantial. I can explain the reasoning behind this number and the capability of teaching 2,000 students. South Korea currently has 40 medical schools. While we often compare the number of doctors per capita with OECD averages, the number of available spots in medical schools is about half that of the OECD average, yet we have more medical schools per capita. This indicates that there are many smaller medical colleges. Unlike other fields of study where fewer professors can teach many students, medical education requires a greater number of faculty members due to the vast array of specialized subjects. Therefore, the student-to-faculty ratio must be high to maintain quality education.

Moreover, Korea has a medical institution evaluation and accreditation system, wherein only graduates from accredited medical schools can take the national medical exam. The criteria for accreditation encompass faculty numbers, facilities, and more. Given Korea's population and scale, having 40 medical schools seems excessive. Presently, each school averages about 60 to 135 students depending on the institution's size. During the 1980s, Seoul National University had a student quota of 260, but with many more faculty members and improved facilities now, the number of students has decreased.

Last December, we conducted a demand survey among the schools, asking how many additional students they could accommodate given their current faculty and facilities. The initial responses indicated that they could support approximately 2,155 students without changes. Some schools mentioned they could accommodate even more with minor investments, suggesting a total of about 2,800. 

We verified these findings through site visits and dialogues with university officials. This led us to conclude that realistically, an intake of 2,000 new students is feasible. This conclusion is based not on the projected demand for healthcare professionals but on assessing the educational capacities of the schools. It is essential first to establish whether there is a current shortage of doctors. Medical supply and demand analysis shows that the current supply does not meet existing demand and will likely worsen by 2035, with projections indicating a shortage of around 15,000 doctors. Hence, in the future, we may need to increase the number well beyond the 2,000 we're considering now.

The calculation indicating a shortage of 10,000 doctors by 2035 is based on recent studies from the KDI, the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, and research by Professor Hong Yun-cheol from Seoul National University. These studies have consistently projected that there will be around a 10,000 doctor shortage in the medical field. While the KDI's projection was slightly over 10,000, the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs estimated it to be around 900. Despite different methodologies, they arrived at similar conclusions, indicating scientific validity in the claim of a 10,000 doctor shortage by 2035.

Currently, there is already a shortage. The average number of doctors per population in South Korea is 2.1 per 1,000 people, with disparities across regions; for example, Seoul has more than three doctors per 1,000, whereas provinces like Gangwon and Gyeongbuk have around 1.x, highlighting a significant gap between regions. To bridge this gap to the national average of 2.1, an additional 5,000 essential doctors are needed, primarily in non-cosmetic essential fields.

When the Medical Association was consulted about these shortages, they argued that current issues could be addressed through methods like raising prices, reallocating resources, and utilizing retired doctors. Some retired doctors are already working in public healthcare settings. The conversation also involved how improved health education and the use of technology like AI could help mitigate demand. The proposal is to cover the 5,000 shortage through resource reallocation and technological advancements while suggesting that 10,000 doctors could be increased through expanding recruitment. 

The Minister of Health announced that the goal is to ensure the necessary number reaches 10,000 by 2035. This plan will involve periodic scientific evaluations to verify the accuracy of these projections. 

To summarize, the critical shortage of essential doctors stands at around 5,000 in South Korea, primarily in rural areas, which may increase to 15,000 over time. The conclusion is that at least 10,000 new doctors should be recruited, particularly for essential fields in rural areas. However, there are concerns that merely increasing numbers will not address the underlying issues; efforts must also focus on creating a conducive environment for doctors to practice in rural areas, such as providing better compensation and working conditions. 

The discussion also addressed historical context as to how reductions in the number of doctors in the past could have influenced the current situation and how solving upcoming shortages may require broad policy changes rather than just numerical increases. The core recommendations include enhancing the attractiveness of essential medical specialties and establishing structures to support medical personnel in rural settings. The four key initiatives laid out include:

1. Expansion of medical workforce and enhancing training programs.
2. Strengthening local healthcare systems to make them more competitive with major hospitals.
3. Establishing safety nets for medical malpractice to protect healthcare workers.
4. Implementing fair compensation structures to rectify imbalances in the current payments for medical services.

Overall, the plan acknowledges both the need for increased numbers of doctors and the necessity of improving their working conditions and the healthcare system itself to retain them, especially in essential fields.

The popularity of certain courses in medical schools has shifted over time, leading to an imbalance in the number of students entering different specialties. This long-standing issue is partly due to government responsibility and partly to the medical community's accountability. Adjusting the relative values of medical services is a complicated process that is more difficult than reaching a consensus between political parties. Specifically, addressing the overpayment for imaging tests and reallocating those funds to underpaid services remains a significant challenge.

The pricing structure for medical services is based on the costs involved in providing them, including labor, space, and equipment. For instance, when surgeries are performed, the costs reflect the time and resources dedicated to the procedure. In the case of imaging tests, however, the costs are primarily determined by the machinery rather than the labor involved in interpreting the results.

Hospitals often perform imaging tests far more frequently than predicted, leading to excessive payment structures that benefit high-volume hospitals, while smaller facilities struggle with underpayment. Attempts to rectify this imbalance met with resistance from both hospitals and relevant specialties, resulting in minimal adjustments to overpayment, which hinders progress in achieving equity.

The healthcare system also faces challenges in compensating essential medical services fairly. For example, doctors on call are not compensated for periods without patient visits, despite the necessity of being available in emergencies. There is a proposal to increase compensation for procedures that carry higher risks and to ensure that on-call times are paid appropriately.

Moreover, the issue of skill and experience in procedures needs to be reflected in payment structures. More advanced procedures requiring years of training should not be compensated the same as less specialized tasks. The government aims to reform the payment system by incorporating factors like waiting times, skill levels, and risk to ensure that essential characteristics of medical services are adequately rewarded, which will likely require an increase in budget.

However, changing this system will take some time. Should we just be sitting idle until then? No, that's why we mentioned an additional 10 trillion won. We are focusing on essential medical services like pediatrics, obstetrics, emergency care, and cardiology, which currently have lower reimbursement rates. We propose to inject additional funding directly into the existing fee schedule without any relation to this system, adding it in increments of 10 trillion won until 2028—this translates to approximately 2 trillion won annually. This will be done fairly and promptly. 

I want to fully explain this today on the 3rd Program because I didn’t have enough opportunities previously. Adjusting relative value is simply redistributing resources among healthcare providers; it does not entail providing extra funds. Changing the fee schedule is a system change that fundamentally alters how resources flow. The additional 10 trillion won will come from the health insurance fund. We won’t be taking money from other areas to give to health insurance but instead will be receiving the premiums and paying out of the health insurance pool. Although there are discussions about deficits, we made a profit of 4 trillion won last year, and over three consecutive years, we've posted surpluses while concerns about deficits have persisted. 

Surpluses are maintained as reserves, and as mentioned, we are accumulating these reserves—28 trillion won to date. However, this raises the question: why are we now addressing the reimbursement issues when there has been money accumulated? The government’s policy direction is crucial. Much of our current discussion focuses on the supply side, which was previously overshadowed by emphasis on enhancing insurance coverage to reduce household medical expenses.

When reinforcing coverage and lowering prices, the resultant increase in demand alters healthcare behaviors, necessitating a more careful approach on the supply side—a consideration that was unfortunate not to have received more attention earlier. Although late, with the presidential directive for healthcare reform, we are striving to implement the long-discussed reforms, including increasing medical school enrollments, while considering the supply side’s issues collectively.

Of course, government proposals may not always be correct, and input from other experts is essential for refining them. For instance, the argument against increasing the number of physicians centers around the idea that competition would reduce individual earnings. However, it's crucial to remember that the healthcare delivery system's challenge is actually related to hospitals rather than outpatient clinics. The focus should be on improving the hospital system.

Our medical institutions are classified into four tiers: advanced hospitals, general hospitals, regular hospitals, and clinics, with a corresponding reimbursement structure. Higher-tier hospitals receive additional funding for taking on more complex cases. If we adequately increase personnel levels, we aim to channel these professionals into the currently struggling higher tier hospitals.

In addition to making hospitals more attractive, we have to ensure that medical professionals are not solely burdened by clinical practices but are also able to engage in research and education—a balance often missed at current hospitals. Models like Harvard's where there are numerous staff dedicated to both academic and clinical roles show how beneficial such arrangements can be. 

My vision for Korea's healthcare system is to construct one that doesn't merely focus on patient care; rather, it should integrate education and research into clinical practices. Increasing university hospital staff significantly would help alleviate the burdens of clinical work, enabling more time dedicated to research. 

Then, do you think it’s sufficient to just invest surplus health insurance funds into the healthcare field rather than letting them accumulate? That’s too simplistic. We need to reevaluate the structure of university hospitals to foster a more specialized approach, allowing for research and development and promoting autonomy in selecting staff. Proper support to ensure that hospitals can operate efficiently, even with increased staff, is important, as is ensuring R&D funding increases concurrently. 

In sum, expanding the medical workforce through medical school admissions and injecting financial resources into improving healthcare facilities must occur simultaneously. Higher manpower should not automatically lead to increased costs for health insurance or create a cycle of deficits and reduced reimbursement. We need to establish a balanced system where increasing supply leads to better overall management and financial health within the medical field. Not all clinics are profitable, particularly for university professors, indicating that not all outpatient clinics are thriving financially.

Don't misunderstand. Please don't assume that all doctors earn a lot of money. However, if you look at private practices, there are indeed those who earn exceptionally well. Ultimately, the overall distribution of incomes, particularly the upper tier, serves as a benchmark for setting wages in the market. This influences the costs that institutions must pay when hiring personnel, which results in higher compensation structures. Personally, I think it's appropriate if this can be lowered to a certain extent. I haven't specifically thought about how low it should go. Therefore, I believe that if we structurally increase the supply, change the infrastructure, and provide support for necessary fees, the system will gradually and smoothly improve.

However, there seems to be a psychological barrier to accepting this good plan. The government has two main responsibilities: one is to invest funds and change laws, and the other is to provide testimony. Based on today's discussion, it appears both must be done. While the government should prioritize making progress on these matters, I believe having a corresponding explanation would also enhance its persuasive power.

We officially announced our essential package on February 1st of this year. However, organizing such a structure is not something that happens overnight. For this discussion, we met 28 times with the Korean Medical Association through the Medical Issues Council, where many discussions took place. We also held separate meetings with the heads and professors of national university hospitals to provide explanations. After much preparatory work, we organized everything into a final paper and presented it on February 1st, with testimonies released on February 6th. 

Unfortunately, the medical community has not fully appreciated the essence of the plan announced on February 1st. Instead, current opinions seem focused on cosmetic surgery markets and issues related to private practice licensing and management, which they see as detrimental policies. While those are necessary measures, they are more peripheral in the grand scheme, and additional discussions are certainly needed in that area. It is unfortunate that the core aspects of the plan are not well understood.

Earlier, a statement made by a vice-minister was quoted in the media suggesting that for public welfare, freedom of job choice might need to be limited. How physicians will perceive this remains uncertain. Is the intent to impose regulations such as "you cannot practice dermatology" or "rather, open a practice in Gangwon-do instead of Seoul"? This ties back to the notion of a "duty to maintain service" despite individual decisions made by residents. 

The command for maintaining medical services is grounded in the Medical Law, stating that the Minister of Health and Welfare can issue necessary orders if there is concern regarding people's health and safety. This is especially relevant if a significant number of specializing doctors suddenly resign, which could indeed create problems in hospitals. Thus, preserving patient care is essential and must be adhered to; failure to comply could result in legal consequences.

It’s necessary to acknowledge that each doctor is a valuable social resource that has invested significant time and money into their profession. Losing such personnel would be detrimental to society as a whole, representing a substantial loss for individuals as well. I sincerely hope for a swift return to patient care. 

We intend to invite representatives to express opposing views shortly, so we ask for your patience until then. Today, we've heard from Deputy Minister Park Min-soo from the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the government's stance on expanding the medical workforce and related reforms. We spent nearly 100 minutes discussing various aspects—have you said all you needed to say? 

Yes, perhaps too much. I wonder how many viewers will stick with an entire 100-minute session; they might give up after 15 minutes. However, for those interested, it’s important to present this comprehensive information. While there are shorter 5, 10, 15, and 20-minute videos covering these issues, we are aware that uploading a longer video may be challenging, especially if future guests require similar lengths. 

It is important to balance things out, considering that we've had previous guests who have also discussed for extended periods. Thank you, Deputy Minister Park Min-soo, for your hard work, and we hope you continue to support the health of our citizens. Thank you very much. Please subscribe and like!
