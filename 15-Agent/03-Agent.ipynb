    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling allows models to detect when one or more **tools** need to be **called and what inputs should be passed** to those tools.\n",
    " \n",
    "In API calls, you can describe tools and intelligently choose to have the model output structured objects like JSON that contain arguments for calling these tools.\n",
    " \n",
    "The goal of the tools API is to return valid and useful **tool calls** more reliably than what could be accomplished using plain text completion or chat APIs.\n",
    " \n",
    "By combining this structured output with the ability to bind multiple tools to a tool-calling chat model and letting the model choose which tools to call, you can create agents that iteratively call tools and receive results until a query is resolved.\n",
    " \n",
    "This is a more **generalized version** of the OpenAI tools agent that was designed specifically for OpenAI's particular tool-calling style.\n",
    " \n",
    "This agent uses LangChain's ToolCall interface to support a wider range of provider implementations beyond OpenAI, including `Anthropic` , `Google Gemini` , and `Mistral` .\n",
