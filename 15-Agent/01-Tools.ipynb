Since then, they’ve enjoyed a steady growth in popularity.\\nThat is until late 2022. Interest in LLMs and the broader discipline of generative AI has skyrocketed. The reasons for this are likely the continuous upward momentum of significant advances in LLMs.\\nWe saw the dramatic news about Google’s “sentient” LaMDA chatbot. The first high-performance and open-source LLM called BLOOM was released. OpenAI released their next-generation text embedding model and the next generation of “GPT-3.5” models.\\nAfter all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight.\\nLangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the first commit in late October 2022. Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.\\nDespite being early days for the library, it is already packed full of incredible features for building amazing tools around the core of LLMs. In this article, we’ll introduce the library and start with the most straightforward component offered by LangChain — LLMs.\\nLangChain\\nAt its core, LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative\\xa0Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more.\\nThe core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\\nWe will dive into each of these in much more detail in upcoming chapters of the LangChain handbook.\\nFor now, we’ll start with the basics behind prompt templates and LLMs. We’ll also explore two LLM options available from the library, using models from Hugging Face Hub or OpenAI.\\n\\nOur First Prompt Templates\\nPrompts being input to LLMs are often structured in different ways so that we can get different results. For Q&A, we could take a user’s question and reformat it for different Q&A styles, like conventional Q&A, a bullet list of answers, or even a summary of problems relevant to the given question.\\nCreating Prompts in LangChain\\nLet’s put together a simple question-answering prompt template. We first need to install the langchain library.\\n!pip install langchain\\nFollow along with the code via\\xa0the walkthrough!\\nFrom here, we import the PromptTemplate class and initialize a template like so:\\nWhen using these prompt template with the given question we will get:\\nQuestion: Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season? Answer:\\nFor now, that’s all we need. We’ll use the same prompt template across both Hugging Face Hub and OpenAI LLM generations.\\nHugging Face Hub LLM\\nThe Hugging Face Hub endpoint in LangChain connects to the Hugging Face Hub and runs the models via their free inference endpoints. We need a Hugging Face account and API key to use these endpoints.\\nOnce you have an API key, we add it to the HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN environment variable. We can do this with Python like so:\\nNext, we must install the huggingface_hub library via Pip.\\n!pip install huggingface_hub\\nNow we can generate text using a Hub model. We’ll use google/flan-t5-x1.\\nThe default Hugging Face Hub inference APIs do not use specialized hardware and, therefore, can be slow. They are also not suitable for running larger models like\\xa0bigscience/bloom-560m\\xa0or\\xa0google/flan-t5-xxl\\xa0(note\\xa0xxl\\xa0vs.\\xa0xl).\\nFor this question, we get the correct answer of \"green bay packers\".\\nAsking Multiple Questions\\nIf we’d like to ask multiple questions, we can try two approaches:\\nStarting with option (1), let’s see how to use the generate method:\\nHere we get bad results except for the first question. This is simply a limitation of the LLM being used.\\nIf the model cannot answer individual questions accurately, grouping all queries into a single prompt is unlikely to work. However, for the sake of experimentation, let’s try it.\\nAs expected, the results are not helpful. We’ll see later that more powerful LLMs can do this.\\nOpenAI LLMs\\nThe OpenAI endpoints in LangChain connect to OpenAI directly or via Azure. We need an OpenAI account and API key to use these endpoints.\\nOnce you have an API key, we add it to the OPENAI_API_TOKEN environment variable. We can do this with Python like so:\\nNext, we must install the openai library via Pip.\\n!pip install openai\\nNow we can generate text using OpenAI’s GPT-3 generation (or completion) models. We’ll use text-davinci-003.\\nAlternatively, if you’re using OpenAI via Azure, you can do:\\nWe’ll use the same simple question-answer prompt template as before with the Hugging Face example. The only change is that we now pass our OpenAI LLM davinci:\\nAs expected, we’re getting the correct answer. We can do the same for multiple questions using generate:\\nMost of our results are correct or have a degree of truth. The model undoubtedly functions better than the google/flan-t5-xl model. As before, let’s try feeding all questions into the model at once.\\nAs we keep rerunning the query, the model will occasionally make errors, but at other times manage to get all answers correct.\\nThat’s it for our introduction to LangChain — a library that allows us to build more advanced apps around LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3 models or the open-source alternatives available via Hugging Face.\\nAs mentioned, LangChain can do much more than we’ve demonstrated here. We’ll be covering these other features in upcoming articles.\\nReferences\\n[1] GPT-3 Archived Repo (2020), OpenAI GitHub\\nChapters\\n© Pinecone Systems, Inc. | San Francisco, CA\\nPinecone is a registered trademark of Pinecone Systems, Inc.\\n'}, {'title': 'Introduction to LangChain - GeeksforGeeks', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-langchain/', 'content': 'Applications of LangChain.

It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications. It allows AI developers to develop applications based on the combined Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 with external sources of computation and data. This framework comes with a package for both Python and JavaScript.\\nLangChain follows a general pipeline where a user asks a question to the language model where the vector representation of the question is used to do a similarity search in the vector database and the relevant information is fetched from the vector database and the response is later fed to the language model. further, the language model generates an answer or takes an action.\\nApplications of LangChain\\nLangChain is a powerful tool that can be used to build a wide range of LLM-powered applications. It is simple to use and has a large user and contributor community.\\nLangChain Key Concepts:\\nThe main properties of LangChain Framework are :\\nSetting up the environment\\nInstallation of langchain is very simple and similar as you install other libraries using the pip command.\\nThere are various LLMs that you can use with LangChain. In this article, I will be using OpenAI. Let us install Openai using the following command:\\nI am also installing the dotenv library to store the API key in an environmental variable. Install it using the command:\\nYou can generate your own API key by signing up to the openai platform.

The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.\\nDevelopers, software engineers and data scientists with experience in the Python, JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages can make use of LangChain's packages offered in those languages. LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022; the initial version was released that same year.\\nWhy is LangChain important?\\nLangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces. Developers working on these types of interfaces use various tools to create advanced NLP apps; LangChain streamlines this process. For example, LLMs have to access large volumes of big data, so LangChain organizes these large quantities of data so that they can be accessed with ease.\\nIn addition, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are generally trained on data up to their release to the public. For instance, ChatGPT was released to the public near the end of 2022, but its knowledge base was limited to data from 2021 and before. LangChain can connect AI models to data sources to give them knowledge of recent data without limitations.\\nThis article is part of\\nWhat is generative AI? Everything you need to know\\nWhat are the features of LangChain?\\nLangChain is made up of the following modules that ensure the multiple components needed to make an effective NLP app can run smoothly:\\nWhat are the integrations of LangChain?\\nLangChain typically builds applications using integrations with LLM providers and external sources where data can be found and stored. For example, LangChain can build chatbots or question-answering systems by integrating an LLM -- such as those from Hugging Face, Cohere and OpenAI -- with data sources or stores such as Apify Actors, Google Search and Wikipedia. This enables an app to take user-input text, process it and retrieve the best answers from any of these sources. In this sense, LangChain integrations make use of the most up-to-date NLP technology to build effective apps.\\nOther potential integrations include cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as vector databases. A vector database can store large volumes of high-dimensional data -- such as videos, images and long-form text -- as mathematical representations that make it easier for an application to query and search for those data elements. Pinecone is an example vector database that can be integrated with LangChain.\\nHow to create prompts in LangChain\\nPrompts serve as input to the LLM that instructs it to return a response, which is often an answer to a query. This response is also referred to as an output. A prompt must be designed and executed correctly to increase the likelihood of a well-written and accurate response from a language model. That is why prompt engineering is an emerging science that has received more attention in recent years.\\nPrompts can be generated easily in LangChain implementations using a prompt template, which will be used as instructions for the underlying LLM. Prompt templates can vary in specificity. They can be designed to pose simple questions to a language model. They can also be used to provide a set of explicit instructions to a language model with enough detail and examples to retrieve a high-quality response.\\nWith Python programming, LangChain has a premade prompt template that takes the form of structured text. The following steps are required to use this:\\nIn this scenario, the language model would be expected to take the two input variables -- the adjective and the content -- and produce a fascinating fact about zebras as its output.\\nHow to develop applications in LangChain\\nLangChain is built to develop apps powered by language model functionality. There are different ways to do this, but the process typically entails some key steps:\\nFor more information on generative AI-related terms, read the following articles:\\nWhat is an AI prompt engineer?\\nWhat is prompt engineering?\\nWhat is synthetic data?\\nExamples and use cases for LangChain\\nThe LLM-based applications LangChain is capable of building can be applied to multiple advanced use cases within various industries and vertical markets, such as the following:\\nReaping the benefits of NLP is a key of why LangChain is important. For a more in-depth understanding of NLP, there are two important subtopics to start with: natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). The goal of NLU is to process a user's intended meaning, while the goal of NLG is to explain an AI system's structured data in human-readable languages for humans to comprehend.\\nGenerative AI isn't going to replace data analysts.

Whether you\\'re considering adding AI capabilities to your app or working on a new project you must\\'ve run into LangChain, the popular LLM framework for Python and Node.js.\\nWhat is LangChain?\\nLangChain is a framework that simplifies integrating LLM capabilities into your application. It supports GPT-4, Gemini, and many other LLMs straight out of the box. LangChain uses chains that are linked together to perform a series of tasks.\\nLangChain comes with built-in support for various data loaders that can retrieve, organize, and create embeddings for use with LLMs. Data loaders are tools that enable you to extract data into chunks from various sources like PDF files and more.\\nDo you need LangChain?\\nSo, do you need to use LangChain?

Unsubscribe anytime.\\nLangChain alternatives\\nOf course, LangChain is not the only data framework out there. There are other popular options. Below I\\'ll highlight why you may want to go with LangChan over its alternatives.\\nWhy use LangChain instead of Haystack?\\nLangChain has more capabilities and supports a broader range of use cases in natural language processing tasks compared to Haystack. It also has greater community support due to its wider developer adoption.\\xa0\\nWhy use LangChain instead of LlamaIndex?\\nLangChain is a broader data framework than LlamaIndex and lets you do more by default. It can also integrate with LlamaIndex for search and retrieval capabilities.\\nWhy use LangChain instead of Semantic Kernel?\\nSemantic Kernel is a great option if you\\'re a C# developer or using the .NET framework. However, LangChain comes with more features out of the box, gets more updates, and you\\'ll find many more resources online if you run into problems due to its wider adoption.\\nHow does LangChain work?\\nA quick overview of LLMs\\nLarge language models (LLMs) perform language tasks. LLMs can’t generate images or a song but they can complete a sentence or any other request that deals with natural language.\\nThey are stateless, meaning they know nothing about their environment, they have no memory of past conversations and they are trained to generate the next word based on all previous ones. - That\\'s it. \\nBut if LLMs know nothing about the exterior environment how can AI apps like ChatGPT answer questions about your documents? That\\'s where custom knowledge comes in!\\nCustom knowledge via RAG\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (or RAG for short) enhances large language models by feeding them extra information they weren\\'t originally trained on. This is especially useful if you\\'re creating an app to interact with specific content, like a PDF or a website.\\nLangChain helps you augment LLM knowledge and build RAG apps.\\nVector Embeddings and Databases\\nIf you have a large document and need specific information from it, you wouldn\\'t paste the whole document and ask the LLM about it. Instead, you only use the parts that are relevant to your question. \\nThis is where vector embeddings and databases come in. Essentially, you transform a document into vectors, then, using fancy mathematical formulas, these vectors are compared with your query for similarity, and only the relevant parts are sent to the LLM.\\nFor example, if we converted your CV into Vector Embeddings and we ran a similarity search using the vector database for the prompt \"Where did the candidate study?\", just the education section of your CV would be returned. \\nPrompt engineering\\nThe output of the LLM is as good as the prompt itself. It is very important that you write descriptive and clear prompts that include essential information for the LLM to generate a useful and accurate response.\\nThe choice of words, information, and structure directly impacts the answer generated by the model.\\nHow LangChain talks to LLMs\\nNow, LangChain comes in and orchestrates the communication between all of these components. Using chains we can index and retrieve data from our vector database. Using another chain, we then send the relevant information  from the data to a LLM. You can link many chains together!\\nLangChain building blocks\\nA chain in LangChain consists of multiple individual components executed in a specific order, allowing you to combine different language model calls and actions automatically.\\nA prompt in LangChain is a specific input that is provided to the large language model which is used to generate a response.\\nA document loader in LangChain is an add-on that lets you load documents from different sources, such as PDFs and Word.\\nAn agent in LangChain is a type of chain that is capable of choosing which action and tools to use to complete a user input. They are similar to Planners in Semantic Kernel.\\nExample code using LangChain\\nThe best way to learn and understand how all of this works is by writing code. I\\'ve compiled the list below from my previous tutorials so you can get started in no time!\\nConclusion\\nLots of developers have already built apps using LangChain and many more will. Its wide adoption means great community support and frequent updates.\\nBefore taking the plunge, consider if you need all the features of LangChain or if you\\'re better off building what you need yourself without dependencies. This may require more effort on your part, however, the benefits are increased stability and lower maintenance.\\nLangChain is a great framework that simplifies the integration of Large Language Models into your application if you\\'re comfortable using Python or Node.js.

This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\\nIntegrations with LLMs\\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks like LangChain and the IBM watsonx platform greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\\n      ![Image 1: 3D design of balls rolling on a track](https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/pm/ul/g/5a/6e/trailv2_1200x1200.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1730807361767.jpeg/content/experience-fragments/adobe-cms/us/en/site-v2/think-hub/article/_8_column_general_ad/blueprint---think-ad---xf---do-not-modify/artificialintelligence-article-newsletter/_jcr_content/root/think_ad_copy/image)\\n\\nThe latest AI News + Insights \\u2028 Expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\\xa0\\nSubscribe today\\nHow does LangChain work?\\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\\nImporting language models\\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\\nPrompt templates\\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\\nChains\\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\\nIndexes\\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\\nDocument loaders\\nLangChain offers\\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\\nVector databases\\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\\xa0vector databases\\xa0represent data points by converting them into\\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\\nText splitters\\xa0\\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\\xa0TextSplitters\\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\\nRetrieval\\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\\xa0its\\xa0retriever\\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\\xa0Document’s as output.\\nMemory\\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\\xa0most recent exchanges.\\nAgents\\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\\n\\na list of available tools to be leveraged.\\nuser input (like prompts and queries).\\nany relevant previously executed steps.\\n\\nTools\\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\\nLangChain tools\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent LangChain tools include:\\n\\n\\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\\n\\n\\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\\n\\n\\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\\n\\n\\nAI Academy\\nWhy foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\\nGo to episode\\nLangSmith\\nReleased in the fall of 2023, LangSmith aims to bridge the gap between the accessible prototyping capabilities that brought LangChain to prominence and building production-quality LLM applications.\\nLangSmith provides tools to monitor, evaluate and debug applications, including the ability to automatically trace all model calls to spot errors and test performance under different model configurations. This visibility aims to empower more robust, cost-efficient applications.\\nGetting started with LangChain\\nLangChain is open source and free to use: source code is\\xa0available for download on Github\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com).\\nLangChain can also be installed on Python with a simple pip command:\\xa0pip install langchain.\\u202fTo install all LangChain dependencies (rather than only those you find necessary), you can run the command\\xa0pip install langchain[all].\\nMany step-by-step tutorials are available from both the greater LangChain community ecosystem and the official documentation at\\xa0docs.langchain.com\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com).\\nLangChain use cases\\nApplications made with LangChain provide great utility for a variety of use cases, from straightforward question-answering and text generation tasks to more complex solutions that use an LLM as a “reasoning engine.”\\n\\nChatbots: Chatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs.\\nSummarization: Language models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.\\nQuestion answering: Using specific documents or specialized knowledge bases (like Wolfram, arXiv or PubMed), LLMs can retrieve relevant information from storage and articulate helpful answers). If fine-tuned or properly prompted, some LLMs can answer many questions even without external information.\\nData augmentation: LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for use in machine learning. For example, an LLM can be trained to generate additional data samples that closely resemble the data points in a training dataset.\\nVirtual agents: Integrated with the right workflows, LangChain’s Agent modules can use an LLM to autonomously determine next steps and take action using robotic process automation (RPA).\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1\\xa0The fastest-growing open-source startups in Q2 2023\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com), Runa Capital, 2023\\nEbook How to choose the right foundation modelLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\\nRead the ebook\\nRelated solutions Foundation models\\nExplore the IBM library of foundation models on the watsonx platform to scale generative AI for your business with confidence.\\nDiscover watsonx.ai Artificial intelligence solutions\\nPut AI to work in your business with IBM's industry-leading AI expertise and portfolio of solutions at your side.\\nExplore AI solutions AI consulting and services\\nReinvent critical workflows and operations by adding AI to maximize experiences, real-time decision-making and business value.\\nExplore AI services\\nResources\\nAI models Explore IBM GraniteIBM® Granite™ is our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

LangChain makes it simpler. This open-source framework brings together LLMs, data modules, and workflow tools—all in one place—to power up your next AI project.\\nLangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). Whether you\\'re building chatbots, intelligent data retrieval systems, or more complex generative applications, LangChain provides a cohesive environment for combining LLMs with different modules to create powerful workflows. Below, we provide an overview of the important concepts, building blocks, and integrations available within LangChain.\\nKey Components and Building Blocks of LangChain\\nLangChain is built around several core packages that serve different purposes:\\n\\nlangchain-core: This package contains the base abstractions and interfaces for all the components of LangChain. It defines the structure for core concepts like LLMs, vector stores, retrievers, etc. Importantly, no third-party integrations are included here, ensuring lightweight dependencies.\\nlangchain: The main package that contains chains, agents, and retrieval strategies. These components form the \"cognitive architecture\" for building applications, and are generic across different integrations.\\nlangchain-community: This package contains community-maintained third-party integrations, covering LLMs, vector stores, and retrievers.\\nPartner Packages: Popular integrations, like those for OpenAI and Anthropic, are separated into distinct packages (e.g., langchain-openai) for better support.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are specialized extensions such as:\\n\\nLangGraph: Designed for building stateful multi-actor applications, LangGraph uses graph modeling to create sophisticated chains and agents.\\nlangserve: A package that helps you deploy LangChain applications as REST APIs for production use.\\nLangSmith: A developer platform that supports debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM-based applications.\\n\\nCore Concepts in LangChain\\n1. Models: LLMs and Chat Models\\n\\nLangChain provides integration with multiple LLMs and chat models. These models are used to generate responses based on input prompts. LangChain does not host any models directly but instead integrates with different third-party providers, including:\\n\\nOpenAI (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4)\\nAnthropic (e.g., Claude)\\nAzure OpenAI Service\\nGoogle Gemini\\nCohere\\nNVIDIA\\nFireworksAI\\nGroq\\nMistralAI\\nTogetherAI\\n\\nThe chat models accept sequences of messages as input, which allows for more dynamic conversational interactions, distinguishing between roles like user, assistant, and system messages.\\n2. Prompt Templates\\nPrompts are the way users communicate instructions to language models. In LangChain, Prompt Templates help convert user input and context into properly formatted prompts that guide the model. Prompt templates can include variables, making it easy to create flexible prompts based on different user inputs.\\nThere are two main types of prompt templates:\\n\\nString Prompt Templates: Used for simpler tasks where the prompt is a single string.\\nChat Prompt Templates: These are used to format more complex prompts involving multiple messages (e.g., system, user, assistant).\\n\\nExample:\\n```javascript\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nprompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\\n])\\n```\\n3. Chains\\nChains are sequences of calls that take user input, process it through models and other tools, and return the result. LangChain provides multiple types of chains:\\n\\nLLMChain: This is the simplest type, consisting of a prompt fed into an LLM.\\nConversationalRetrievalChain: A more complex chain used for building conversational applications that need context retrieval from past conversations.\\n\\n4. Agents\\nAgents are dynamic systems that use an LLM to decide which actions to take next. They form the decision-making backbone of applications that need to interact with tools or APIs based on user inputs.\\n\\nReAct Agents: These agents use reasoning and acting steps iteratively to complete tasks. For example, they might call a search tool, analyze the results, and decide on the next action.\\nLangGraph Agents: These are more advanced agents aimed at highly controllable and customizable use cases. LangGraph provides the flexibility to compose custom flows using graph-based modeling.\\n\\n5. Chat History\\n\\nLangChain provides Chat History functionality, which is crucial for conversational applications. It enables the system to refer back to previous messages, thus maintaining context throughout the conversation.\\n6. Output Parsers\\nOutput Parsers are used to convert the raw text output from models into structured formats. LangChain supports a variety of parsers, such as:\\n\\nJSON Output Parser: Converts output into a JSON object based on a specified schema.\\nCSV Output Parser: Returns data as a list of comma-separated values.\\nPandas DataFrame Parser: Converts output into a Pandas DataFrame for easy data manipulation.\\n\\nOutput parsers are especially useful when working with structured data or integrating LLMs with downstream applications.\\n7. Retrievers and Vector Stores\\nRetrievers are used to fetch documents based on a query. A Vector Store is a common implementation where documents are embedded into vector representations and then searched using similarity metrics.\\n\\nPopular Vector Stores: LangChain integrates with vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS, making it easy to set up retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\\nRetrievers from Vector Stores: You can use vector stores to create retrievers that perform similarity searches and return relevant documents.\\n\\n8. Tools and Toolkits\\n\\nTools are utility functions that an LLM can call to execute specific tasks, such as making an API call or querying a database.\\n\\nToolkits: A collection of tools designed for specific tasks. For instance, a toolkit might include tools for querying a database, sending an email, or summarizing a document.\\n\\nLangChain\\'s tools have a name, a description, and a defined schema for inputs, making it easy for the LLM to determine which tool to use in a given context.\\nLangChain Integrations\\nLangChain supports many integrations to enhance its capabilities:\\n\\nLLM Integrations: As mentioned earlier, LangChain can integrate with various LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.\\nDocument Loaders: These are used to bring data into LangChain from sources like Google Drive, Notion, Slack, and databases.\\nText Splitters: Text splitters help divide larger documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks, making them suitable for LLM processing. For instance, you can split HTML using HTMLHeaderTextSplitter or Markdown with MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter.\\nKey-Value Stores: LangChain also offers key-value stores for use cases like retrieval caching and embeddings management.\\n\\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nLCEL is a declarative way to chain components together. It provides features like:\\n\\nStreaming: LCEL allows streaming of tokens from an LLM to output parsers, offering fast, real-time user experiences.\\nAsync Support: Chains defined with LCEL can be run asynchronously, enabling concurrency and better performance in production environments.\\nRetries and Fallbacks: LCEL supports robust error handling, such as retrying failed requests and configuring fallbacks for different scenarios.\\n\\nExample LCEL usage:\\n```javascript\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"What\\'s the weather like in {location}?\")\\nmodel = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3\")\\nchain = prompt | model\\n```\\nLangChain Packages for Specialized Use Cases\\n1. LangGraph\\nLangGraph is aimed at building applications with robust state management. It extends LangChain to enable complex, stateful interactions by modeling the workflow as a graph of nodes and edges. This helps in designing reliable, multi-step agents and defining how data flows between components.\\n2. LangServe\\nLangServe makes it easy to deploy LangChain applications as REST APIs. This is particularly useful for developers looking to deploy LLM applications in a production environment without needing to manually manage server infrastructure.\\n3. LangSmith\\nLangSmith is a platform for testing, debugging, and monitoring LLM applications. It provides powerful tools for tracking the performance of models, understanding the logic behind their responses, and visualizing how different parts of your chain contribute to the final result.\\nPutting It All Together\\nTo create a complete LangChain application, you need to:\\n\\nChoose the right models (e.g., OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 or Anthropic\\'s Claude).\\nDesign a chain or agent that defines how different components (e.g., LLMs, tools, retrievers) interact to achieve your goal.\\nDefine prompts and output parsers to guide the model’s output into the appropriate form.\\nUse LangServe to deploy your application and LangSmith to monitor and test it.\\n\\nExample: Building a Simple LLM Application with LCEL\\nIn this quickstart example, we\\'ll show you how to build a simple LLM application that translates text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application—just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, it\\'s a great way to get started with LangChain, as many features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\\nSetup\\nTo follow along, you\\'ll need to have LangChain installed. You can install it via pip:\\njavascript\\npip install langchain\\nYou\\'ll also need an API key for the LLM provider of your choice, such as OpenAI.\\nUsing Language Models\\nFirst, let\\'s initialize a language model. In this example, we\\'ll use OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 model.\\n```javascript\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nSet your OpenAI API key\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"your_openai_api_key_here\"\\nInitialize the model\\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\")\\n```\\nPrompt Templates and Output Parsers\\nNext, let\\'s define a prompt template and an output parser.\\n```javascript\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\nDefine the prompt template\\nprompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"Translate the following into {language}:\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"{text}\")\\n])\\nDefine the output parser\\nparser = StrOutputParser()\\n```\\nChaining Components Together with LCEL\\nNow, we\\'ll use LCEL to chain the prompt, model, and parser together.\\n```javascript\\nCreate the chain\\nchain = prompt_template | model | parser\\nInvoke the chain\\nresult = chain.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"Hello, how are you?\"})\\nprint(result)  # Output: \\'Ciao, come stai?\\'\\n```\\nDeploying with LangServe\\nTo deploy this chain as a REST API, you can use LangServe.\\n```javascript\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\\nfrom langserve import add_routes\\nDefine the FastAPI app\\napp = FastAPI(title=\"Translation API\", version=\"1.0\")\\nAdd the chain route\\nadd_routes(app, chain, path=\"/translate\")\\nif name == \"main\":\\n    import uvicorn\\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"localhost\", port=8000)\\n```\\nYou can now run this script to serve your chain at http://localhost:8000/translate.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLangChain offers a powerful, flexible framework to build applications powered by language models. With support for different integrations, complex workflows, and robust monitoring tools, it provides all the tools needed to build sophisticated LLM applications. Our simple example shows how you can start building your own applications by chaining components together and deploying them with ease.\\n\\u200d\\nCohorte Team\\nNovember 5, 2024\\n\\nWant to see what AI can do for you?\\nBook a free workshop with me.\\nGet Started\\nGet a free actionable hack every week in your inbox\\nJoin my newsletter\\n\\n© 2024 Cohorte\\nPrivacy PolicyTerms of Service\\n'}], 'response_time': 6.85}\n"
